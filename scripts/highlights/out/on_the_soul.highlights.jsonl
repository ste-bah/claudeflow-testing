Further, the power of originating movement\rcannot belong to a harmony, while all concur in regarding this pretty well as a\r408*1 principal attribute of soul. It is more appropriate to call health (or generally one of\rthe good states of the body) a harmony than to predicate it of the soul. The\rabsurdity becomes most apparent when we try to attribute the active and passive\r5 affections of the soul to a harmony—it is difficult to harmonize them. Further, in\rusing the word ‘harmony’ we have one or other of two cases in mind: the most proper\rsense is in relation to magnitudes which have motion and position, where harmony\rmeans their being compounded and harmonized in such a manner as to prevent the\rintroduction of anything homogeneous; and the derived sense is that in which it\rmeans the ratio between the constituents so blended; in neither of these senses is it\rplausible to predicate it of soul. That soul is a harmony in the sense of the\r10 composition of the parts of the body is a view easily refutable; for there are many\rand various compoundings of the parts; of what is thought or the sensitive or the\rappetitive faculty the composition? And what is the composition which constitutes\reach of them?
