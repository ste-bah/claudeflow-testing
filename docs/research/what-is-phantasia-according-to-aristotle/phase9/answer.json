            "text": "Phantasia 493\n\nis known by like. Wherein now lies the danger of mistaking phantasia\nfor thinking? This possible confusion seems to have two basic sources.\n   The first is that both thinking and phantasia may occur in the absence\nof a sensible object. The example that Aristotle offers of mnemonists\nordering their images within themselves42 illustrates this well. While\nsensation requires the physical presence of its object, phantasia, like\nthinking, has for its immediate object something interior which remains\nand may be “arranged” for consideration in the absence of sensible\nthings.43 Thus, both thinking and phantasia have an interiority and an\nindependence of the sensible world which makes them resemble one\nanother. The ordinary view perhaps does not distinguish between\nthoughtful reflection employing logos and the inspection of phantas-\nmata, and Aristotle will show how closely these two are in fact inter¬\n woven.\n   The second respect in which thinking and phantasia are alike is that\n both may similarly serve as inner springs of animal activity: “Again,\n because imaginations persist in us and resemble sensations, living crea¬\n tures frequently act in accordance with them {kaf antas'), some, viz. , the\n brutes, because they have no mind (noun), and some, viz., men, be¬\n cause the mind (noun) is temporarily clouded over by emotion, or\n disease, or sleep.”44 This resemblance later leads Aristotle to allow that\n phantasia may actually be called a certain noesis:\nThese two, then, appetite (orexis) and mind (nous) are clearly capable of causing move¬\nment if, that is, one regards imagination (phantasia) as some sort of thinking process\n(noesin); for men often follow their imaginations (phantasai) contrary to knowledge, and\nin living creatures other than man there is neither thinking (noesis) nor calculation\n(logismos), but only imagination (phantasia).45\n\nThus, from the point of view of animal activity, as well as of human\nactivity in so far as it is generated by the passions of the body, phantasia\nand nous seem to perform analogous originating functions and to be\ninterchangeable one for the other.\n  Since, both from its interiority and from its orientation to action,\nphantasia has the appearance of a kind of thinking, Aristotle is thus\ncompelled to distinguish these two cognitive activities. He at once does\nso in a cursory way, as he has distinguished thinking from sensing, by\nmentioning two clear indications of their difference: the first is that the\nexercise of phantasia rests with us, as in the case of the mnemonic\narrangement of images, while judging something to be so (doxazein) is\nnot circumscribed by our activity, but involves some reference beyond\nus by which it is true or false; the second is that when our judgment\n 42 427bl8-20.\n 43 Cf. Il, 5, 417bl8-27.\n 44 III, 3, 429a4-8. The texts of Aristotle are quoted in the translation by W. S. Hett in the\n    Loeb Classical Library edition of On the Soul, Parra Natttralia, On Breath (Cam¬\n    bridge, MA: Harvard University Press; and London: William Heinemann, 1957).\n 45 III, 10, 433a9-12.\n\n494 Dialogue\n\nconfronts something fearful or terrible we are immediately moved, while\nphantasia coolly regards such affecting scenes as one would a picture.46\nThese indications are clearly meant to compel the reader’s immediate\nassent and to allow Aristotle to proceed with the assumption that phan¬\ntasia and thinking are distinct activities of the soul. Yet they are not\nsufficient to permit him to pass directly beyond phantasia to a discus¬\nsion of noein .\n   In a remark introducing the necessary excursus on phantasia , Aristo¬\ntle anticipates a major theme of his analysis of thinking, namely, that the\nactivity of noein in man is somehow double, comprising one dimension\nwhich belongs to the sensible world and one which does not: “As for\nthought (noein), since it is distinct from perception (aisthanesthai), and\nis held to comprise imagination and judgment (to men phantasia dokei\neinai to de hypolepsis), it will be best to discuss it after having completed\nour analysis of imagination (phantasia).\"41 Having once been touched\non, the theme of phantasia cannot now be abandoned. This is not only\nbecause it is interesting in its own right, as a power of the soul which has\nyet to be defined: Aristotle in fact has thus far expressed little needfor an\naccount of phantasia in his investigation of the soul. It is rather because\nan understanding of phantasia will be necessary to the explanation of\n the human activity of noein. While phantasia is often found in isolation\nfrom noein, in man as well as in the other animals, its primary signifi¬\ncance for Aristotle in the De anima lies in its instrumentality with\n respect to this human activity.",

This                         function and the occasion of their occurrence in dreams, hallucinations, memory,\nmeans that just as in the case of dreams, the status of beliefs embedded in sensory                      thoughts, or decisions. Most of all, their character and value may vary: they may\nmemories remains unaccounted for.47                                                                      be clear or confused, simple or complex, true or false. In spite of this range and\n   If Aristotle wants to keep the two faculties separate and regards phantasia only                      flexibility it seems that Aristotle’s insistence on their sensory nature indicates that\nas a necessary link between sensory and non-sensory mental activities, a link,                           he regarded them, with good reasons, as a unitary phenomenon in the soul, as\nhowever, that remains firmly confined to the sensory side, then he must have seen                        sensory appearances.50\ngood reasons for doing this, for the difficulties entailed by his dualism can have\n                                                                                                            50 For an interpretation that reaches similar\nhardly escaped his notice. One of his reasons must certainly have been that he did                                                                        results but is much more extensive and technically\n                                                                                                         refined cf. Wedin (1988). A discussion of his very rich investigations would exceed the limits of this\nnot want to accept any physical impact on the functioning of the intellect per se,                       article.\nwhich would be implied if there were more than an accidental connection. Fur¬\nthermore, he may not have wanted to give up the link between the best part in us\nand the only divinity that he recognizes: the pure active mind (cf. 4o8bi8-2g;\nMetaph. 983’6-7).\n   The dualism that I maintain for Aristotle does not make his philosophy of\nmind incoherent. It imports some awkwardnesses that seem to be unavoidable for\nany metaphysics that distinguishes between the corporeal and the incorporeal in a\nstrong sense, since the question of their connection and interaction necessarily\narises. Aristotle must have hoped that his conception of phantasia would help to\novercome that awkwardness.\n   The relationship between phantasia (or aisthesis in the wider sense) and nous\nhas recently been likened to that between matter and form.48 As a metaphor this\nis perhaps not unacceptable since the senses do deliver the material that reason\nworks on. The metaphor has its dangers, however, since it suggests a necessary\nrelationship between them. In opposition, however, to matter in its usual sense,\nphantasiai can and do exist by themselves; they need not be ‘informed’ by\nthought. And, more importantly, phantasiai are sometimes quite recalcitrant and\nresist ‘information’. As Aristotle asserts in Insomn. 458b28, ‘so even when persons\nare in excellent health, and know the facts of the case perfectly well, the sun,\nnevertheless, appears to them to be a foot wide’. Thus, phantasiai, even though\nthey often function as incentives for thought, as substrates of thought, and the\nanchor of thought in the physical world, remain phenomena in their own right.\n    I have largely treated phantasia as a unified concept in Aristotle; but is that\n justified, or is there not rather only a ‘more or less coherent family of psychic\n phenomena, a loose-knit family concept?49 If one excludes the metaphoric mean¬\n ing of ‘phantasizing’, then at least the causal account for all imagination is the\nsame: all phantasiai are motions in the soul caused by sense-perceptions. They\n are sensory images or imprints that can exist independently from their original\n source. Their history may be quite different, depending on whether they are due\n to immediate awareness or have undergone a long-term storage, as may be their\n\n47 Esp. in Insomn. the difficulty is obvious since Aristotle distinguishes between opinions that are\n\npart of dreams and opinions we have in sleep besides the dreams (458bi 5). Nevertheless he defines\ndreams as phantasmata in sleep (459’19).\n  48   Cf. Modrak (1987a), 123-4, 215 n. 29.\n  49 Cf.

            "text": "Aristotle says that phantasia is that in virtue of which we say that any\nphantasma comes to be in us: kath’hen legomen phantasma ti hemin\ngignesthai.11 This terse, almost tautologous definition contains some\ninteresting features. Note, first of all, that Aristotle is describing phan¬\ntasia according to what seems to be the ordinary way of speaking: it is\nthat by which we say a phantasma comes to be in us. Note, too, that\nphantasia is made to account for the genesis of the phantasma . But what\nis this phantasma within us which is recognized in ordinary discourse?\nLike its cognates, phantasma suggests the action of appearing, but more\nspecifically it points to the transfer of an appearance from its origin in\nthat which appears into another medium. Thus, Plato uses phantasmata\nto name the reflections which things cast into the unstable medium of\nwater, an example which vividly illustrates the difference between the\noriginal which appears and its separated and transformed appearance.\nOften, however, Plato’s use of the word indicates a deceptive appear¬\nance in particular, suggesting that phantasmata are reflections which\ncannot be trusted to show the truth about their originals.18\n   The striking difference between Plato’s use of phantasma and that of\n Aristotle is that, while Plato makes it describe every sort of reflected\n appearance, including visible reflections, mistaken impressions,\ndreams, and the “reflections” of things in speech,19 Aristotle uses it\nexclusively to describe the inner appearances or “reflections” which\n are evident in such activities as dreaming and remembering, instances in\n which we ourselves are the medium into which the reflected appear¬\n ances are cast, transformed, and separated from their originals. These\n inner phantasmata are clearly a special kind of appearance, since, as\n has been said, an appearance usually seems to involve a union between\n something which appears and someone to whom it appears, or a union of\n the outer world and an inner act of recognition. It seems, however, that\n an appearance can become wholly interiorized, so that the subjective\n pole becomes overwhelmingly predominant: the inner appearance is not\n only for the individual to whom it appears, but it is for him alone , since\n he contains it.\n    Aristotle’s description of phantasia as that in virtue of which\n {kath’hen} these inner appearances are generated is somewhat clarified\n by the definition of kath’ho in Metaphysics , V, 18, which states that this\n term has as many senses as aition (“cause”).20 Thus, phantasia as it is\n commonly understood would seem to signify the hypothesis of an under¬\n lying action of the soul, a moving cause which serves to account for the\n presence in us of phantasmata. In pursuing this supposition, then, we\n are led to consider the genesis of these inner appearances and the action\n of phantasia and its phantasmata in the life of the human soul.\n17 De anima, III, 3, 428al-2.\n18 Republic, VI, 510al; II, 382a2; Sophist, 236b7; c3, 4, 7; 239c9.\n19 Republic, VI, 510al; IX, 584a9; Timaeus, 46a2; Sophist, 267a4.\n20 !022al9-20.\n\n488 Dialogue\n\n2. The Context of the Discussion of Phantasia\n2.1. The Plan of the De Anima\nThe De anima's remarks on phantasia prior to the thematic discussion\nof III, 3 are few and fragmentary. We learn that thinking seems to be\nintimately related to phantasia', that phantasia, along with desire, is\nconcomitant with the power of sensation; that the place of phantasia\namong the powers of the soul is unclear and must be dealt with as a\nseparate question; that the animals which possess phantasia live ac¬\ncording to it; that phantasia is somehow involved with the production of\nvoice; and that phantasiai persist in the sense organs after the sense\nobjects are gone.21 Apart from the vague remark at 414bl6, nothing has\nprepared us for a thematic discussion of phantasia at this point, and\neven within III, 3 the theme of phantasia seems to emerge incidentally\nin the course of a discussion of the difference between sensing and\nthinking. This discussion is apparently intended to provide a transition\nbetween the treatment of sensation (II, 5-III, 2) and that of nous (III,\n4-8). For our purposes it is important to note first of all that the account\nof phantasia is required for this development. Before focussing on this\ntransition itself, however, we might raise a question about its two terms:\nwhat is Aristotle’s rationale in passing from the subject of sensation to\nthe subject of thought? While the progression from one cognitive power\n to another more complex one might strike us as an unremarkable didac¬\n tic procedure, it invites us to consider the overall plan and coherence of\n the De anima and the peculiar nature of Aristotle’s approach to the\nstudy of the soul. Such a consideration is appropriate to our theme: as\n we shall see, the analysis of phantasia contains implications which\n involve some of the most far-reaching and original conclusions of Aris¬\n totle’s investigation of the soul. Our immediate concern, then, is to\n situate the chapter on phantasia within the structure of the De anima.\n    Although the treatise contains clear and frequent articulations of its\n topics which suggest careful composition and edition, the overall plan of\n the book, particularly of its latter half, is not easy to delineate. Certainly,\n the first chapter is introductory, and is followed by four chapters which\n pursue Aristotle’s normal procedure of examining the opinions of his\n predecessors. Furthermore, the first two chapters of Book II clearly\n take up the concern, announced in the introduction, with finding a\n universal definition of the soul. Then, after an analysis of the different\n psychic powers possessed by different kinds of souls (II, 3), the ac¬\n tivities of nutrition (II, 4), sensation (II, 5-III, 2), phantasia (III, 3),\n thought (III, 4-8), and locomotion (III, 9-11) are taken up in turn, fol¬\n lowed by some further remarks on sensation (III, 12-13). What is the\n ordering principle behind the portion of the treatise which follows III, 3?\n21 I, 1, 403a8-10; II, 2, 4I3b22-23; 3, 414bl6, 415al0-ll; 8, 420b29-33; III, 2, 425b24-25.",

The importance of experience for practical wisdom is\nclearly based on the preserving activity of phantasia.\n   In an illuminating image, Aristotle compares the use made by the\nnoetic soul of phantasia to the role of diagrams in geometry:\nIt is impossible even to think (noein) without a mental picture (phantasmatos). The same\naffection (pathos) is involved in thinking (noein ) as in drawing a diagram; for in this case\nalthough we make no use of the fact that the magnitude of a triangle is a finite quality, yet\nwe draw it as having a finite magnitude. In the same way the man who is thinking (ho\nnoon), though he may not be thinking of a finite magnitude, still puts a finite magnitude\nbefore his eyes, though he does not think of it as such . And even if the nature of the object is\nquantitative, but indeterminate, he still puts before him a finite magnitude, although he\nthinks of it as merely quantitative. Why it is impossible to think of anything without\ncontinuity ( ton synechons) or to think of things which are timeless except in terms of time,\nis another question/’\n\nPhantasia resembles Plato’s “painter in the soul”, whose job is to\nillustrate the text of the soul’s grasp of truth.82 As a geometer with a\nportable slate, the noetic soul considers truth at its leisure, not because it\nhas no need of paradigmatic sensible images, but because it can produce\nits own such images in the activity of phantasia. Phantasia preserves\nthe characteristic features of sensible things, such as their determinate\nquantity, but nous is able to disregard these and to disengage the\nimmaterial “being” of material beings, much as a geometer makes use of\na specific right-angled triangle in deducing a truth about all such trian¬\ngles . It might be noted in passing that this comparison perhaps indicates\nthat Aristotle is here responding to the Republic's account of the divided\nline-, which also compares a certain kind of thinking (dianoia) to the\nimage-making activity of geometers . 83 But while Socrates there attempts\nto describe a higher kind of thinking (noesis) which makes no use of\nimages whatsoever,84 Aristotle, like the Glauconofthe Republic, seems\n80 De anima, III, 7, 431b2-IO. The role of phantasia in practical thinking and animal\n   activity is further developed in De anima. III, 10-1 1, which is doctrinally parallel to De\n   motn animalinm , 6-8. See, for discussion of these passages, Nussbaum, Aristotle’s De\n   motif animalittm, 232-24).\n81 De memoria et reminiscentia , 1, 449b31-450a9.\n82 Philbens, 39b Iff.\n83 VI, 51 lai, e2.\n84 51 Id8.\n\nPhantasia 503\n\nto have difficulty in conceiving the possibility of such a pure and image¬\nless thought.\n    Nous, then, depends on phantasia to provide the relative steadiness\nwhich it requires of its object. A further point, however, one which may\nbe even more important for an understanding of human activity, is that\nthe continuousness of noein is also a requirement of the very nature of\nnous itself. Thinking, according to Aristotle, is both an activity which of\nits very nature tends towards a constant, uninterrupted actualization,85\nas well as the activity which man can perform most continuously.86 The\ndiscussion of the life of nous at the conclusion of the Nicomachean\nEthics (X, 6-8) suggests that human thought, the imperfect image of the\nlife of the gods, takes its nobility and resemblance to the divine from the\ndegree to which it is able to operate with some continuity. It would seem\nto be a measure of the importance of phantasia to man that it provides\nsome secure foundation, however intermittently, for this divine opera¬\ntion in the life of a perishable being.\n    The need for the hypothesis of phantasia in an account of the human\nsoul seems to arise from the complexity of human cognition, or, more\nspecifically, from the complex way in which human cognition is related\n to time. In souls characterized by sensation alone, phantasia gives rise\n to memory and desire, prolonging the now of sensation into past and\nfuture for the sake of the animal’s preservation. In the noetic or human\n soul, however, phantasia is a step in man’s progression beyond time\n altogether, enabling him at certain points and for certain periods to pass\n beyond the confinements of sense to a consideration of the timeless\n natures of things. Tobe sure, the imperfection of this transcendence may\n be attributed to the origins of phantasia in the time-conditioned circum¬\n stances of sensation. But while phantasia may be the source of the\n failure of human noein to fully realize itself, it is also what makes this\n activity possible at all.\n    The two prominent moments of human cognition, nous and aisthesis,\n are strikingly similar in their empty receptivity and in their total,\n present-directed absorption in the forms of beings, though the fleeting\n present of sensation and the abiding present of mathematical truth are\n apparently essentially disjoined. The union of these two presents, and\n hence the unity of the human soul, require the mediating activity of\n phantasia, which does not merely receive, as do nous and aisthesis, but\n also retains, in order that the present of sensation may be made to\n resemble the present of mathematics. Phantasia achieves this resem¬\n  blance, however imperfectly, simply by allowing the movement of sen¬\n sation to persist. Because the impermanent sensible beings are thereby,\n in their reflections within us, caused to imitate the fixed noeta, human\n  thinking in turn is enabled to imitate the noetic life of the gods.\n85 De anima.

By internalizing and preserving\nsuch features, the power of phantasia provides man with a familiar\ninterior landscape which, in contrast with the sensible beings in them¬\nselves, he may consult with confidence in its permanence.

Problems with a Unified Concept of Phantasia\n\nThe difficulties with the concept of phantasia start with the translation. One\nproblem is that phantasia does triple duty. It designates the capacity, the activity’\nor process, and the product or result. It is, of course, not alone in having so many\nchores. ‘Sight’, for example, in English has as many functions: it signifies the\ncapacity to see, the seeing, and what is seen. This multiplicity need not by itself\ncreate any confusions. We usually know quite well whether we mean the capacity\nof sight or the seeing or the thing seen. Even grammatically it is usually clear\nwhat we mean: ‘you are a terrible sight’ is quite unequivocal, as is ‘my sight is\ngetting worse and worse’.\n   What makes phantasia more troublesome than ‘vision’ is partly that we have no\nsingle word in English that would do all three jobs. But, unfortunately, that is not\nthe major problem in Aristotle. We are also unsure what capacity, what process,\nand what product the word denotes in each case. In order to provide a prelim¬\ninary clarification I want, as other commentators have done before me, to refer to\nthe etymological derivation of phantasia from phainesthai or phantazesthai' and\nclaim that ‘appearance’ in a wider sense should be regarded as the central mean¬\ning to which all functions of the term are related. It would then be (i) the capacity\nto experience an appearance, (ii) the on-going appearance itself, and (iii) what\nappears.\n   Sometimes, however, this does not seem appropriate; rather something like\nour ‘imagination’ would be more adequate. The latter sense is not unrelated to\n‘appearance’, since it means something like the creation of an appearance, so that\nit is related to the former like active to passive (or medium).2 Unfortunately this\nis still not all, there is yet another distinction to be observed. Just as we do in\n\n© Dorothea Frede, 1992.\n   1\n     Cf. Schofield (1979), 105 n. it. Aristotle often treats phantasia as the noun corresponding to\nphainesthai (cf. DA, 428ÿ7, 14; 428bt, 3; 433’28). Where there is no question of simple appearance but\nintentional imagining is meant he uses phantasthÿnai (433bi 2).\n   2 In its active sense it also has those three functions, and ‘imagination’\n                                                                              covers all three meanings:\nthe capacity to create appearances, the creating itself (‘imagining’) and the created appearance itself,\nwhat is imagined. Aristotle does not use phantasia for poetic creativity but calls the poet an eikÿnopoios\n(Pa. I46ob9). For an interesting overview of the history of the ‘creative’ sense of phantasia cf.\nRosenmeyer (1986).\n\n28o                                        Dorothea Frede                                                                                      The Cognitive Role of Phantasia                                      281\nEnglish, so one distinguishes in Greek between a ‘mere appearance’, a phantom,                                 syndrome to an unusual degree.

Furthermore, at first phantasia is said to be ‘up\nthe many meanings, the crucial question remains: what kinds of ‘appearances’                                   to us’, since we can imagine what we please while suppositions depend on the\ndoes Aristotle have in mind and why should there be a special capacity for them?                               external circumstances since they are true or false (427bi8).

Observing that something which is moved by another may in\nturn move something else, and that phantasia itself seems to be some\nsort of motion, one which depends on sensation, he quickly arrives at the\ndefinition of phantasia as “a movement produced by sensation actively\noperating” (kinesis hypo tes aistheseos tes kat’energeian gigno-\nmenes).55 Such a secondary movement necessarily resembles sensation,\nwhich in turn is an assimilation to the sensible object; moreover, the\nmovement of phantasia evidently continues in the absence of the sensi¬\nble object and the inoperancy of the sense-power.56 Thus phantasia , as\nthe power whereby sensation is capable of generating a likeness of itself\nwhich survives it, might be likened to a reproductive faculty: through it,\nthe momentary, stillborn life of sensations is perpetuated in their off¬\nspring.57\n    Although this brief sketch of phantasia in terms of kinesis requires\nmuch amplification, it is important first to see why in itself it is signifi¬\ncant for Aristotle. On the one hand, by describing phantasia in terms of\none of the most fundamental and manifest features of the physical\n world,58 it specifies phantasia, in contradistinction to noein, as an\norganic, bodily event; and therefore subject to all the limitations from\n which nous in its passionless incorporeity is exempt.59 On the other\n hand, in characterizing phantasia as a secondary motion arising from\n sensation, Aristotle seems to be appealing to ordinary experience of the\n inner appearances. His book on dreams, which further develops the De\n anima's account of phantasia, investigates this ordinary experience in\n greater detail.\n    After noting the fact that the experience (pathos) which occurs in\n sensation persists when sensations themselves have ceased, the second\n chapter of the De insomniis compares this persistence to the career of\n serially moved projectiles, the movement of one of which may continue\n when its mover is at rest. Something similar occurs in the “movement”\n of change of state (alloiosis), as when something heated transmits its\n heat to something else; and as with sensation itself, whose actualization\n is also a certain alloiosis, which explains why its pathos persists when\n the sense organs are no longer active. As evidence of the fact itself,\n54 De anima, II, 5 and 12.\n55 III, 3, 428b 10-1 1, 429al-2.\n56 428b 14, 429a4-5.\n57 Cf. note 13 above.\n58 Cf. Physics, I, 1, 185al4.\n59 De anima, III, 5, 430al7-18.\n\nPhantasia 497\n\nAristotle invites us to consider the effect of gazing at something continu¬\nously for a while, and then abruptly shifting our attention to something\ndifferent: in turning from sunlight to darkness, from one colour to\nanother, or from moving things to things at rest, we notice that some\ntrace of the first object appears (phainetaf) for a time in our considera¬\ntion of the second.60\n   Aristotle finds in these slight indications a sufficient explanation of\ndreaming: by day, when our senses and thought are active, the persisting\ntraces of sensation are obscured, as a small fire is by a greater; but when\nthese present-directed activities are at rest, the continuing reverbera¬\ntions of sensation are left to occupy the centre of attention.61 This\nexplanation suggests that the activity of phantasia may prove to be a\nproblem for its subject, since the difference between present sensation\nand the present persistence of past sensation seems to be a kind of\ntension, potentially dividing man between his present and his past,\nbetween what confronts him in the world and what preoccupies him\nwithin.\n   The De insomniis also repeats the De anima's definition of phan¬\ntasia, and in so doing it even more closely unites the powers of phan¬\ntasia and aisthesisx\n... the imaginative (phantastikon) is the same as the sensitive faculty, although the\nimaginative and the sensitive are different in essence (einai)-, and since imagination\n(phantasia) is the process set up by a sense faculty in a state of activity (he hypo tes\nkat'energeian aistheseos gignomene kinesis), and a dream appears to be some sort of\nmental image (phantasma) (for an image [phantasma] which appears in sleep, whether\nsimply or in a special sense, we call a dream); it is clear that dreaming belongs to the\nsensitive faculty, but belongs to it qua imaginative (het phantastikon).62",

Neither is imagination any of the\n things that are never in error: e.g. knowledge or intelligence; for imagination may be\n false.\n       It remains therefore to see if it is opinion, for opinion may be either true or\n false.\n       But opinion involves belief (for without belief in what we opine we cannot have                20\nan opinion), and in the brutes though we often find imagination we never find belief.\n Further, every opinion is accompanied by belief, belief by conviction, and conviction\nby discourse of reason, while there are some of the brutes in which we find\nimagination, without discourse of reason.32 It is clear then that imagination cannot,\nagain, be opinion plus sensation, or opinion mediated by sensation, or a blend of                     25\nopinion and sensation; this is impossible both for these reasons and because the\ncontent of the supposed opinion cannot be different from that of the sensation (I\nmean that imagination must be the blending of the perception of white with the\nopinion that it is white: it could scarcely be a blend of the opinion that it is good with\nthe perception that it is white): to imagine is therefore (on this view) identical with               428bi\nthe thinking of exactly the same as what one perceives non-incidentally. But what\nwe imagine is sometimes false though our contemporaneous judgement about it is\ntrue; e.g. we imagine the sun to be a foot in diameter though we are convinced that it\nis larger than the inhabited part of the earth. Thus either while the fact has not\nchanged and the observer has neither forgotten nor lost belief in the true opinion\nwhich he had, that opinion has disappeared, or if he retains it then his opinion is at                5\nonce true and false. A true opinion, however, becomes false only when the fact alters\nwithout being noticed.\n       Imagination is therefore neither any one of the states enumerated, nor\ncompounded out of them.\n       But since when one thing has been set in motion another thing may be moved                     10\nby it, and imagination is held to be a movement and to be impossible without\nsensation, i.e. to occur in beings that are percipient and to have for its content what\ncan be perceived, and since movement may be produced by actual sensation and\nthat movement is necessarily similar in character to the sensation itself, this\nmovement cannot exist apart from sensation or in creatures that do not perceive,                      15\nand its possessor does and undergoes many things in virtue of it, and it is true and\nfalse.\n      The reason is as follows. Perception of the special objects of sense is never in\nerror or admits the least possible amount of falsehood. Next comes perception that\nwhat is incidental to the objects of perception is incidental to them: in this case                   20\ncertainly we may be deceived; for while the perception that there is white before us\ncannot be false, the perception that what is white is this or that may be false. Third\ncomes the perception of the common attributes which accompany the incidental\nobjects to which the special sensibles attach (I mean e.g. of movement and\nmagnitude); it is in respect of these that the greatest amount of sense-illusion is                   25\npossible.\n\nJ2Ross, following Bichl, excises ‘Further .. reason’, as a doublet of lines 19-22.\n\n682                            ON THE SOUL\n\nThe motion which is due to the activity of sense in these three modes of its\n        exercise will differ; the first kind of derived motion is free from error while the\n        sensation is present; the others may be erroneous whether it is present or absent,\n        especially when the object of perception is far off. If then imagination presents no\n429*1   other features than those enumerated and is what we have described, then\n        imagination must be a movement resulting from an actual exercise of a power of\n        sense.\n             As sight is the most highly developed sense, the name (jxxvTctola (imagination)\n        has been formed from (f>aos (light) because it is not possible to see without light.\n    5        And because imaginations remain in the organs of sense and resemble\n        sensations, animals in their actions are largely guided by them, some (i.e. the\n        brutes) because of the non-existence in them of thought, others (i.e. men) because\n        of the temporary eclipse in them of thought by feeling or disease or sleep.\n             About imagination, what it is and why it exists, let so much suffice.",
