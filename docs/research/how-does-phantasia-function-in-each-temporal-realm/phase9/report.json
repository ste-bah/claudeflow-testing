          "text": "Phantasia 493\n\nis known by like. Wherein now lies the danger of mistaking phantasia\nfor thinking? This possible confusion seems to have two basic sources.\n   The first is that both thinking and phantasia may occur in the absence\nof a sensible object. The example that Aristotle offers of mnemonists\nordering their images within themselves42 illustrates this well. While\nsensation requires the physical presence of its object, phantasia, like\nthinking, has for its immediate object something interior which remains\nand may be “arranged” for consideration in the absence of sensible\nthings.43 Thus, both thinking and phantasia have an interiority and an\nindependence of the sensible world which makes them resemble one\nanother. The ordinary view perhaps does not distinguish between\nthoughtful reflection employing logos and the inspection of phantas-\nmata, and Aristotle will show how closely these two are in fact inter¬\n woven.\n   The second respect in which thinking and phantasia are alike is that\n both may similarly serve as inner springs of animal activity: “Again,\n because imaginations persist in us and resemble sensations, living crea¬\n tures frequently act in accordance with them {kaf antas'), some, viz. , the\n brutes, because they have no mind (noun), and some, viz., men, be¬\n cause the mind (noun) is temporarily clouded over by emotion, or\n disease, or sleep.”44 This resemblance later leads Aristotle to allow that\n phantasia may actually be called a certain noesis:\nThese two, then, appetite (orexis) and mind (nous) are clearly capable of causing move¬\nment if, that is, one regards imagination (phantasia) as some sort of thinking process\n(noesin); for men often follow their imaginations (phantasai) contrary to knowledge, and\nin living creatures other than man there is neither thinking (noesis) nor calculation\n(logismos), but only imagination (phantasia).45\n\nThus, from the point of view of animal activity, as well as of human\nactivity in so far as it is generated by the passions of the body, phantasia\nand nous seem to perform analogous originating functions and to be\ninterchangeable one for the other.\n  Since, both from its interiority and from its orientation to action,\nphantasia has the appearance of a kind of thinking, Aristotle is thus\ncompelled to distinguish these two cognitive activities. He at once does\nso in a cursory way, as he has distinguished thinking from sensing, by\nmentioning two clear indications of their difference: the first is that the\nexercise of phantasia rests with us, as in the case of the mnemonic\narrangement of images, while judging something to be so (doxazein) is\nnot circumscribed by our activity, but involves some reference beyond\nus by which it is true or false; the second is that when our judgment\n 42 427bl8-20.\n 43 Cf. Il, 5, 417bl8-27.\n 44 III, 3, 429a4-8. The texts of Aristotle are quoted in the translation by W. S. Hett in the\n    Loeb Classical Library edition of On the Soul, Parra Natttralia, On Breath (Cam¬\n    bridge, MA: Harvard University Press; and London: William Heinemann, 1957).\n 45 III, 10, 433a9-12.\n\n494 Dialogue\n\nconfronts something fearful or terrible we are immediately moved, while\nphantasia coolly regards such affecting scenes as one would a picture.46\nThese indications are clearly meant to compel the reader’s immediate\nassent and to allow Aristotle to proceed with the assumption that phan¬\ntasia and thinking are distinct activities of the soul. Yet they are not\nsufficient to permit him to pass directly beyond phantasia to a discus¬\nsion of noein .\n   In a remark introducing the necessary excursus on phantasia , Aristo¬\ntle anticipates a major theme of his analysis of thinking, namely, that the\nactivity of noein in man is somehow double, comprising one dimension\nwhich belongs to the sensible world and one which does not: “As for\nthought (noein), since it is distinct from perception (aisthanesthai), and\nis held to comprise imagination and judgment (to men phantasia dokei\neinai to de hypolepsis), it will be best to discuss it after having completed\nour analysis of imagination (phantasia).\"41 Having once been touched\non, the theme of phantasia cannot now be abandoned. This is not only\nbecause it is interesting in its own right, as a power of the soul which has\nyet to be defined: Aristotle in fact has thus far expressed little needfor an\naccount of phantasia in his investigation of the soul. It is rather because\nan understanding of phantasia will be necessary to the explanation of\n the human activity of noein. While phantasia is often found in isolation\nfrom noein, in man as well as in the other animals, its primary signifi¬\ncance for Aristotle in the De anima lies in its instrumentality with\n respect to this human activity.",

          "text": "Once having gained a foothold in time by means of phantasia, nous is\ncapable of putting its survey of the past into the service of a calculation\nof the future. The importance of experience for practical wisdom is\nclearly based on the preserving activity of phantasia.\n   In an illuminating image, Aristotle compares the use made by the\nnoetic soul of phantasia to the role of diagrams in geometry:\nIt is impossible even to think (noein) without a mental picture (phantasmatos). The same\naffection (pathos) is involved in thinking (noein ) as in drawing a diagram; for in this case\nalthough we make no use of the fact that the magnitude of a triangle is a finite quality, yet\nwe draw it as having a finite magnitude. In the same way the man who is thinking (ho\nnoon), though he may not be thinking of a finite magnitude, still puts a finite magnitude\nbefore his eyes, though he does not think of it as such . And even if the nature of the object is\nquantitative, but indeterminate, he still puts before him a finite magnitude, although he\nthinks of it as merely quantitative. Why it is impossible to think of anything without\ncontinuity ( ton synechons) or to think of things which are timeless except in terms of time,\nis another question/’\n\nPhantasia resembles Plato’s “painter in the soul”, whose job is to\nillustrate the text of the soul’s grasp of truth.82 As a geometer with a\nportable slate, the noetic soul considers truth at its leisure, not because it\nhas no need of paradigmatic sensible images, but because it can produce\nits own such images in the activity of phantasia. Phantasia preserves\nthe characteristic features of sensible things, such as their determinate\nquantity, but nous is able to disregard these and to disengage the\nimmaterial “being” of material beings, much as a geometer makes use of\na specific right-angled triangle in deducing a truth about all such trian¬\ngles . It might be noted in passing that this comparison perhaps indicates\nthat Aristotle is here responding to the Republic's account of the divided\nline-, which also compares a certain kind of thinking (dianoia) to the\nimage-making activity of geometers . 83 But while Socrates there attempts\nto describe a higher kind of thinking (noesis) which makes no use of\nimages whatsoever,84 Aristotle, like the Glauconofthe Republic, seems\n80 De anima, III, 7, 431b2-IO. The role of phantasia in practical thinking and animal\n   activity is further developed in De anima. III, 10-1 1, which is doctrinally parallel to De\n   motn animalinm , 6-8. See, for discussion of these passages, Nussbaum, Aristotle’s De\n   motif animalittm, 232-24).\n81 De memoria et reminiscentia , 1, 449b31-450a9.\n82 Philbens, 39b Iff.\n83 VI, 51 lai, e2.\n84 51 Id8.\n\nPhantasia 503\n\nto have difficulty in conceiving the possibility of such a pure and image¬\nless thought.\n    Nous, then, depends on phantasia to provide the relative steadiness\nwhich it requires of its object. A further point, however, one which may\nbe even more important for an understanding of human activity, is that\nthe continuousness of noein is also a requirement of the very nature of\nnous itself. Thinking, according to Aristotle, is both an activity which of\nits very nature tends towards a constant, uninterrupted actualization,85\nas well as the activity which man can perform most continuously.86 The\ndiscussion of the life of nous at the conclusion of the Nicomachean\nEthics (X, 6-8) suggests that human thought, the imperfect image of the\nlife of the gods, takes its nobility and resemblance to the divine from the\ndegree to which it is able to operate with some continuity. It would seem\nto be a measure of the importance of phantasia to man that it provides\nsome secure foundation, however intermittently, for this divine opera¬\ntion in the life of a perishable being.\n    The need for the hypothesis of phantasia in an account of the human\nsoul seems to arise from the complexity of human cognition, or, more\nspecifically, from the complex way in which human cognition is related\n to time. In souls characterized by sensation alone, phantasia gives rise\n to memory and desire, prolonging the now of sensation into past and\nfuture for the sake of the animal’s preservation. In the noetic or human\n soul, however, phantasia is a step in man’s progression beyond time\n altogether, enabling him at certain points and for certain periods to pass\n beyond the confinements of sense to a consideration of the timeless\n natures of things. Tobe sure, the imperfection of this transcendence may\n be attributed to the origins of phantasia in the time-conditioned circum¬\n stances of sensation. But while phantasia may be the source of the\n failure of human noein to fully realize itself, it is also what makes this\n activity possible at all.\n    The two prominent moments of human cognition, nous and aisthesis,\n are strikingly similar in their empty receptivity and in their total,\n present-directed absorption in the forms of beings, though the fleeting\n present of sensation and the abiding present of mathematical truth are\n apparently essentially disjoined. The union of these two presents, and\n hence the unity of the human soul, require the mediating activity of\n phantasia, which does not merely receive, as do nous and aisthesis, but\n also retains, in order that the present of sensation may be made to\n resemble the present of mathematics. Phantasia achieves this resem¬\n  blance, however imperfectly, simply by allowing the movement of sen¬\n sation to persist. Because the impermanent sensible beings are thereby,\n in their reflections within us, caused to imitate the fixed noeta, human\n  thinking in turn is enabled to imitate the noetic life of the gods.\n85 De anima.

          "text": "Aristotle says that phantasia is that in virtue of which we say that any\nphantasma comes to be in us: kath’hen legomen phantasma ti hemin\ngignesthai.11 This terse, almost tautologous definition contains some\ninteresting features. Note, first of all, that Aristotle is describing phan¬\ntasia according to what seems to be the ordinary way of speaking: it is\nthat by which we say a phantasma comes to be in us. Note, too, that\nphantasia is made to account for the genesis of the phantasma . But what\nis this phantasma within us which is recognized in ordinary discourse?\nLike its cognates, phantasma suggests the action of appearing, but more\nspecifically it points to the transfer of an appearance from its origin in\nthat which appears into another medium. Thus, Plato uses phantasmata\nto name the reflections which things cast into the unstable medium of\nwater, an example which vividly illustrates the difference between the\noriginal which appears and its separated and transformed appearance.\nOften, however, Plato’s use of the word indicates a deceptive appear¬\nance in particular, suggesting that phantasmata are reflections which\ncannot be trusted to show the truth about their originals.18\n   The striking difference between Plato’s use of phantasma and that of\n Aristotle is that, while Plato makes it describe every sort of reflected\n appearance, including visible reflections, mistaken impressions,\ndreams, and the “reflections” of things in speech,19 Aristotle uses it\nexclusively to describe the inner appearances or “reflections” which\n are evident in such activities as dreaming and remembering, instances in\n which we ourselves are the medium into which the reflected appear¬\n ances are cast, transformed, and separated from their originals. These\n inner phantasmata are clearly a special kind of appearance, since, as\n has been said, an appearance usually seems to involve a union between\n something which appears and someone to whom it appears, or a union of\n the outer world and an inner act of recognition. It seems, however, that\n an appearance can become wholly interiorized, so that the subjective\n pole becomes overwhelmingly predominant: the inner appearance is not\n only for the individual to whom it appears, but it is for him alone , since\n he contains it.\n    Aristotle’s description of phantasia as that in virtue of which\n {kath’hen} these inner appearances are generated is somewhat clarified\n by the definition of kath’ho in Metaphysics , V, 18, which states that this\n term has as many senses as aition (“cause”).20 Thus, phantasia as it is\n commonly understood would seem to signify the hypothesis of an under¬\n lying action of the soul, a moving cause which serves to account for the\n presence in us of phantasmata. In pursuing this supposition, then, we\n are led to consider the genesis of these inner appearances and the action\n of phantasia and its phantasmata in the life of the human soul.\n17 De anima, III, 3, 428al-2.\n18 Republic, VI, 510al; II, 382a2; Sophist, 236b7; c3, 4, 7; 239c9.\n19 Republic, VI, 510al; IX, 584a9; Timaeus, 46a2; Sophist, 267a4.\n20 !022al9-20.\n\n488 Dialogue\n\n2. The Context of the Discussion of Phantasia\n2.1. The Plan of the De Anima\nThe De anima's remarks on phantasia prior to the thematic discussion\nof III, 3 are few and fragmentary. We learn that thinking seems to be\nintimately related to phantasia', that phantasia, along with desire, is\nconcomitant with the power of sensation; that the place of phantasia\namong the powers of the soul is unclear and must be dealt with as a\nseparate question; that the animals which possess phantasia live ac¬\ncording to it; that phantasia is somehow involved with the production of\nvoice; and that phantasiai persist in the sense organs after the sense\nobjects are gone.21 Apart from the vague remark at 414bl6, nothing has\nprepared us for a thematic discussion of phantasia at this point, and\neven within III, 3 the theme of phantasia seems to emerge incidentally\nin the course of a discussion of the difference between sensing and\nthinking. This discussion is apparently intended to provide a transition\nbetween the treatment of sensation (II, 5-III, 2) and that of nous (III,\n4-8). For our purposes it is important to note first of all that the account\nof phantasia is required for this development. Before focussing on this\ntransition itself, however, we might raise a question about its two terms:\nwhat is Aristotle’s rationale in passing from the subject of sensation to\nthe subject of thought? While the progression from one cognitive power\n to another more complex one might strike us as an unremarkable didac¬\n tic procedure, it invites us to consider the overall plan and coherence of\n the De anima and the peculiar nature of Aristotle’s approach to the\nstudy of the soul. Such a consideration is appropriate to our theme: as\n we shall see, the analysis of phantasia contains implications which\n involve some of the most far-reaching and original conclusions of Aris¬\n totle’s investigation of the soul. Our immediate concern, then, is to\n situate the chapter on phantasia within the structure of the De anima.\n    Although the treatise contains clear and frequent articulations of its\n topics which suggest careful composition and edition, the overall plan of\n the book, particularly of its latter half, is not easy to delineate. Certainly,\n the first chapter is introductory, and is followed by four chapters which\n pursue Aristotle’s normal procedure of examining the opinions of his\n predecessors. Furthermore, the first two chapters of Book II clearly\n take up the concern, announced in the introduction, with finding a\n universal definition of the soul. Then, after an analysis of the different\n psychic powers possessed by different kinds of souls (II, 3), the ac¬\n tivities of nutrition (II, 4), sensation (II, 5-III, 2), phantasia (III, 3),\n thought (III, 4-8), and locomotion (III, 9-11) are taken up in turn, fol¬\n lowed by some further remarks on sensation (III, 12-13). What is the\n ordering principle behind the portion of the treatise which follows III, 3?\n21 I, 1, 403a8-10; II, 2, 4I3b22-23; 3, 414bl6, 415al0-ll; 8, 420b29-33; III, 2, 425b24-25.",

By internalizing and preserving\nsuch features, the power of phantasia provides man with a familiar\ninterior landscape which, in contrast with the sensible beings in them¬\nselves, he may consult with confidence in its permanence. The relative\npermanence conferred on the sensible beings by phantasia is necessary\nand interesting to man in many practical ways , but its highest function is\nto provide an index of orientation and differentiation to the power of\nnous , and it is this highest function which points to the motive for the De\nanima's digression on phantasia, as well as to the deepest meaning of\nthe inner appearances in the life of the human soul.\n   Aristotle’s various suggestions concerning the role of phantasia in\nhuman life would seem to be of particular relevance in our own time,\nwhen the scene of the outer appearances has been overlaid and inten¬\nsified with an unprecedented proliferation of man-made phantasmata .\nUnlike the appearances of nature, these artificial phantasmata, which\nare in large part “appearances” of man himself, are formed from the\nbeginning to become “inner appearances” and thereby to affect the\ncourse of human thought, passion, and ultimately action.

Neither is imagination any of the\n things that are never in error: e.g. knowledge or intelligence; for imagination may be\n false.\n       It remains therefore to see if it is opinion, for opinion may be either true or\n false.\n       But opinion involves belief (for without belief in what we opine we cannot have                20\nan opinion), and in the brutes though we often find imagination we never find belief.\n Further, every opinion is accompanied by belief, belief by conviction, and conviction\nby discourse of reason, while there are some of the brutes in which we find\nimagination, without discourse of reason.32 It is clear then that imagination cannot,\nagain, be opinion plus sensation, or opinion mediated by sensation, or a blend of                     25\nopinion and sensation; this is impossible both for these reasons and because the\ncontent of the supposed opinion cannot be different from that of the sensation (I\nmean that imagination must be the blending of the perception of white with the\nopinion that it is white: it could scarcely be a blend of the opinion that it is good with\nthe perception that it is white): to imagine is therefore (on this view) identical with               428bi\nthe thinking of exactly the same as what one perceives non-incidentally. But what\nwe imagine is sometimes false though our contemporaneous judgement about it is\ntrue; e.g. we imagine the sun to be a foot in diameter though we are convinced that it\nis larger than the inhabited part of the earth. Thus either while the fact has not\nchanged and the observer has neither forgotten nor lost belief in the true opinion\nwhich he had, that opinion has disappeared, or if he retains it then his opinion is at                5\nonce true and false. A true opinion, however, becomes false only when the fact alters\nwithout being noticed.\n       Imagination is therefore neither any one of the states enumerated, nor\ncompounded out of them.\n       But since when one thing has been set in motion another thing may be moved                     10\nby it, and imagination is held to be a movement and to be impossible without\nsensation, i.e. to occur in beings that are percipient and to have for its content what\ncan be perceived, and since movement may be produced by actual sensation and\nthat movement is necessarily similar in character to the sensation itself, this\nmovement cannot exist apart from sensation or in creatures that do not perceive,                      15\nand its possessor does and undergoes many things in virtue of it, and it is true and\nfalse.\n      The reason is as follows. Perception of the special objects of sense is never in\nerror or admits the least possible amount of falsehood. Next comes perception that\nwhat is incidental to the objects of perception is incidental to them: in this case                   20\ncertainly we may be deceived; for while the perception that there is white before us\ncannot be false, the perception that what is white is this or that may be false. Third\ncomes the perception of the common attributes which accompany the incidental\nobjects to which the special sensibles attach (I mean e.g. of movement and\nmagnitude); it is in respect of these that the greatest amount of sense-illusion is                   25\npossible.\n\nJ2Ross, following Bichl, excises ‘Further .. reason’, as a doublet of lines 19-22.\n\n682                            ON THE SOUL\n\nThe motion which is due to the activity of sense in these three modes of its\n        exercise will differ; the first kind of derived motion is free from error while the\n        sensation is present; the others may be erroneous whether it is present or absent,\n        especially when the object of perception is far off. If then imagination presents no\n429*1   other features than those enumerated and is what we have described, then\n        imagination must be a movement resulting from an actual exercise of a power of\n        sense.\n             As sight is the most highly developed sense, the name (jxxvTctola (imagination)\n        has been formed from (f>aos (light) because it is not possible to see without light.\n    5        And because imaginations remain in the organs of sense and resemble\n        sensations, animals in their actions are largely guided by them, some (i.e. the\n        brutes) because of the non-existence in them of thought, others (i.e. men) because\n        of the temporary eclipse in them of thought by feeling or disease or sleep.\n             About imagination, what it is and why it exists, let so much suffice.",

In every case the mind which is actively\n          thinking is the objects which it thinks.

Within the soul the faculties of knowledge and sensation are\n         potentially these objects, the one what is knowable, the other what is sensible. They\n         must be either the things themselves or their forms. The former alternative is of\n         course impossible: it is not the stone which is present in the soul but its form.\n432*1          It follows that the soul is analogous to the hand; for as the hand is a tool of\n         tools, so thought is the form of forms and sense the form of sensible things.\n               Since it seems that there is nothing outside and separate in existence from\n    5    sensible spatial magnitudes, the objects of thought are in the sensible forms, viz.\n         both the abstract objects and all the states and affections of sensible things.

          "text": "Phantasia 501\n\ntion is not why phantasia may serve nous equally with aisthesis, but\nwhy it is valuable to nous in a way in which aisthesis cannot be.\n   Aristotle’s text suggests a number of answers to this question, all of\nthem revolving around a single important point: noein, it seems, re¬\nquires some degree of permanence in the sensible beings if it is to be able\nto penetrate their material coverings and reveal to itself their intelligible\ninteriority. While it is true that their sensible forms afford some perma¬\nnence to the material beings, this permanence is extremely unreliable,\nsubject as it is to the abrupt changes of the continually vanishing sensible\nworld. More crucially, the immediate human contact with the sensible\nbeings, aisthesis, is an instantaneous, ever-new event which is wholly\nconfined to the fragment of time Aristotle calls “the now’’ ,76 Even to the\nextent that the sensible beings show some degree of constancy, our\nsensitive apprehension of them is inevitably momentary and changing.\nAisthesis continually offers to nous its object, but only to at once\nwithdraw it and substitute a different object. Even if nous could follow\naisthesis through its transformations, glimpsing the essence or mathe¬\nmatical aspect of each object in rapid succession, these would not be\ngrasped as the unmoving or timeless einai which nous requires for its\nobject. The action of phantasia, which lends to the appearances a\nstability which they do not have of themselves, would seem to be the\nhuman soul’s response to this dilemma. By means of preserved phan-\ntasmata, nous is enabled to continuously behold its timeless object,\neven when the mediating sensible thing is past, absent or in motion.\n    As an illustration of how phantasia extends the range of nous beyond\nthe now, we may note how necessary preserved phantasmata are to the\nprocess of learning.77 Without this retention and accumulation of past\nencounters with sensible beings, it is clear that there could be no acquisi¬\n tion of knowledge, but only a forgetful succession of insights. This\ndependency of nous on phantasia for retention, however, reveals to us\n that of itself the power of thought has no memory. This in turn makes the\n similarity between nous and aisthesis even closer, since both seem to be\n purely present actualizations, aisthesis because of its confinement to\n the now, and nous because of its orientation to the timeless. This is not\n to say that phantasia is simply identical with memory, which Aristotle\n takes to be a special activity of phantasia in which the appearances\n (phantasmata) are regarded as images (eikones) of sensible objects in\n the past.78 Nevertheless, while it is not the pastness of the objects of\n phantasia as such to which noesis is directed,79 it is their deliverance\n from the passing of time which allows noesis to make use of them.\n76 Physics, IV, 10-14; cf. Nicomachean Ethics, X, 4, 1 174al3-17.\n77 Cf. De anima, HI, 8, 432a7-9.\n78 De memoria et reminiscentia, 1, 450a25-451al4.\n79 Aristotle says that objects of noesis are only incidentally objects of memory (ibid.,\n   450a24-25).\n\n502    Dialogue\n\nIn a less direct way, phantasia also seems to extend the range of nous\ninto the future. Aristotle brings this out in showing the interplay of\npractical thinking, desire, and the phantasmata:\nSo the thinking faculty (noetikon) thinks the forms (eide) in the mental images (pliantas-\nmasi). and just as in the sphere of sense what is to be pursued and avoided is defined for it,\nso also outside sensation, when it is occupied with mental images (phantasmuton), is\nmoved. ... But sometimes by means of the images (phuittasmasin) or thoughts (noemasin)\nin the soul, just as if it were seeing, it calculates and plans for the future in view of the\npresent; and when it makes a statement, as in sensation it asserts that an object is pleasant\nor unpleasant, in this case it avoids or pursues; and so generally in action/0",

Therefore, the origin of the moving soul must be in the middle; for of both\n        extremes the middle is the limiting point; and this is similarly related to the\n        movements from above and below—e.g. from the head—and to those which spring\n        from the spinal column, in creatures that have a spinal column.\n   20         And this is a reasonable arrangement. For the sensorium is in our opinion in\n        the centre too; and so, if the region of the origin is altered through sense-perception\n        and thus changes, the adjacent parts change with it and they too are extended or\n        contracted, and in this way the movement of the creature necessarily follows. And\n   25   the middle of the body must needs be in potency one but in actuality more than one;\n        for the limbs are moved simultaneously from the origin, and when one is at rest the\n        other is moved. For example, in the line ABC, B is moved, and A is the mover. There\n   30   must, however, be a point at rest if one is to move, the other to be moved. A then\n        being one in potency must be two in actuality, and so be a magnitude not a point.\n        Again, C may be moved simultaneously with B. Both the origin then in A must\n        move and be moved, and so there must be something other than them which moves\n   35   but is not moved. For otherwise, when the movement begins, the extremes, i.e. the\n        origin, in A would rest upon one another, like two men putting themselves back to\n703’1   back and so moving their legs. There must then be some one thing which moves\n        both. This something is the soul, distinct from the magnitude just described and yet\n        located therein.\n\n10 • Although from the point of view of the account which gives the cause of\n    5    movement desire is the middle, and desire moves being moved, still in the animated\n         body there must be some body of this kind. Now that which is moved, but whose\n         nature is not to initiate movement, is capable of being passive to an external power,\n        while that which initiates movement must needs possess a kind of force and power.\n         Now it is clear that animals do both possess connatural spirit and derive force from\n  10    this. (How this connatural spirit is maintained in the body is explained in other\n        passages of our works.) And this spirit appears to stand to the soul-origin in a\n        relation analogous to that between the point in a joint which moves being moved and\n        the unmoved. Now since this origin is for some animals in the heart, in the rest in a\n  15    part analogous with the heart, for this reason the connatural spirit is clearly there\n        too. (The question whether the spirit remains always the same or constantly\n        changes must be discussed elsewhere; for the same question arises about the rest of\n\nMOVEMENT OF ANIMALS                                       1095\nthe parts of the body.) At all events we see that it is well disposed to excite\nmovement and to exert force. Now the functions of movement are thrusting and\npulling. Accordingly, the organ of movement must be capable of expanding and              20\ncontracting; and this is precisely the characteristic of spirit. It contracts and\nexpands without constraint, and so is able to pull and to thrust from one and the\nsame cause, exhibiting weight compared with the fiery element, and lightness by\ncomparison with the opposites of fire. Now that which is to initiate movement             25\nwithout alteration must be of the kind described; for the natural bodies prevail over\none another by dint of predominance; the light is overcome and kept down by the\nheavier, and the heavy kept up by the lighter.\n      We have now explained what the part is which is moved when the soul\noriginates movement, and what is the reason for this. And the animal organism\nmust be conceived after the similitude of a well-governed commonwealth. When              30\norder is once established in a city there is no more need of a separate monarch to\npreside over each several task. The individuals each play their assigned part as it is\nordered, and one thing follows another because of habit. So in animals the same\nthing happens because of nature, each part naturally doing its own work as nature         35\nhas composed it. There is no need then of a soul in each part, but it resides in a kind\nof origin of the body, and the remaining parts live by being naturally connected, and     703bi\nplay their parts because of their nature.",
