          "text": "The English word “appearance” connotes an interesting polarity,\nsince an appearance is always both of something and for someone, and\nitself seems to be engendered in a unique coming-together of something\nand someone: an appearance of one thing is not like that of another,\nwhile, on the other hand, the appearance of something to one person\nmay differ from its appearance to another.12 This duality parallels a\nsimilar polarity in the word phantasia which is reflected in two basic\nuses which Aristotle makes of the word, uses described by Bonitz as\nspeciem rei obiectae ... sive veram sive fallacem and as earn actionem\nqua rerum imagines animo informamus and by J. Freudenthal as\nAussehen or Erscheinung and as Vorstellung or Einbildung14 respec¬\ntively. While this sharp distinction of meaning may conceal an important\nambiguity of the word, it seems clear that Aristotle uses the term both in\nan “objective” sense, to describe the species or “look” of something,\nand in a “subjective’’ sense, to describe the action of the soul in grasping\nsuch a “look”.15 The first sense occurs mostly in his physical writings,\n usually as naming the “look” of one of the heavenly bodies or of a\ncolour; the second usage is found in the psychological treatises, and\n describes a certain action by which the soul presents something to itself.\nSince our interest is in the human activity of phantasia , we shall all but\n exclusively be concerned with the “psychological” or “subjective”\n meaning of the word. This concern leads us to consider the special\n nature of certain kinds of “appearances” or “presentations”, namely,\n those Aristotle calls phantasmata .\n   Setting aside the transferred {kata metaphoran) meanings of the\n      —\n word perhaps referring to the “objective” sense just mentioned16\n   history of German philosophy seems to reverse this progression, beginning with Kant’s\n                                                                                           —\n   distinction between the phenomena and the noumena, and ending with phenomen¬\n   ology’s exclusive attention to the appearances. This latter development also coincides\n   with the growth of “historicism”, a modern version of the Protagorean doctrine that\n   “man is the measure of all things”.\n12 The continual engendering of unique and unrepeatable appearances by the ever-\n   renewed union of sense and sensible things is a central point in the discussion of the first\n   definition of knowledge in Plato’s Theaetetus (151d3-186e12). The fascination to which\n   this perpetual novelty gives rise is, of course, an important Platonic theme.\n13 H. Bonitz, Index Aristotelians (2nd ed.; Graz: Akademische Druck—U. Verlagsan-\n   stalt, 1955), \"phantasia” .\n14 J. Freudenthal, Ueberden Begriff des Wortes PHANTASIA bei Aristoteles (Gottingen:\n                            —\n   Druck der Universitats Buchdruckerei von E. A. Huth, 1863), 15-16.\n15 It should be mentioned that “look” is the English word chosen by Jacob Klein to\n   translate Plato’s terms eidos and idea ; see Plato’s Trilogy (Chicago, IL: University of\n   Chicago Press, 1977), 3. The visual terminology of species, Erscheinung and “look”,\n   reflects the root meaning of phantasia , but is somewhat misleading, since Aristotle will\n   relate the action of phantasia to sensation in general. The double sense of phantasia is\n   paralleled in the related term doxa , which, in the writings of Plato, also shows both an\n   “objective” and a “subjective” meaning. See Yvon Lafrance, La Theorie Platoni-\n   cienne de la Doxa (Montreal: Bellarmin; and Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1981), 22.\n16 For other suggestions of what Aristotle has in mind here, see Freudenthal, Ueber den\n   Begriff, 30, and Martha Craven Nussbaum, Aristotle’s De motu animalium: Text with\n   Translation, Commentary and Interpretative Essays (Princeton, NJ: Princeton Uni¬\n    versity Press, 1978), 252-255.\n\nPhantasia 487",

But numerical\n         relations are not actualized except in the sense which has been elsewhere stated;\n    20   actualizations in the sense of movement they have not. Of relations which imply\n         capacity some further imply particular periods of time, e.g. that which has made is\n         relative to that which has been made and that which will make to that which will be\n         made.

          "text": "same things; and all these are in other things and none is separable. Further, how\n         are we to suppose that there is a substance of unity and the point? Every substance\n         comes into being, but the point does not; for the point is a division.\n    20        A further difficulty is raised by the fact that all knowledge is of universals and\n         of the ‘such’, but substance does not belong to universals, but is rather a ‘this’ and\n         separable, so that if there is knowledge about the first principles, the question arises,\n         how are we to suppose the first principle to be substance?\n              Further, is there anything apart from the compound thing (by which I mean\n    25   the matter and that which is joined with matter), or not? If not, all things that are in\n         matter are perishable. But if there is something, it must be the form or shape. It is\n         hard to determine in which cases this exists apart and in which it does not; for in\n         some cases the form is evidently not separable, e.g. in the case of a house.\n              Further, are the principles the same in kind or in number? If they are one in\n    30   number, all things will be the same.\n\n3 • Since the science of the philosopher treats of being qua being universally\n         and not of some part of it, and ‘being’ has many senses and is not used in one only, it\n         follows that if it is used homonymously and in virtue of no common nature, it does\n         not fall under one science (for there is no one class in the case of such things); but if\n    35   it is used in virtue of some common nature, it will fall under one science. The term\n         seems to be used in the way we have mentioned, like ‘medical’ and ‘healthy’. For\n1061*1   each of these also we use in many senses; and each is used in this way because the\n         former refers somehow to medical science and the latter to health. Other terms\n         refer to other things, but each term refers to some one thing. For a prescription and\n         a knife are called medical because the former proceeds from medical science, and\n     5   the latter is useful to it. And a thing is called healthy in the same way; one thing\n         because it is indicative of health, another because it is productive of it. And the\n         same is true in the other cases. Everything that is, then, is said to be in this same\n         way; each thing is said to be because it is a modification of being qua being or a\n    10   permanent or a transient state or a movement of it, or something else of the sort.\n         And since everything that is may be referred to some one common nature, each of\n         the contrarieties also may be referred to the first differences and contrarieties of\n         being, whether the first differences of being are plurality and unity or likeness and\n    15\n         unlikeness, or some other differences; let these be taken as already discussed. It\n         makes no difference whether that which is be referred to being or to unity. For even\n         i t ey are not the same but different, they are convertible; for that which is one is\n         a so some ow eing, and that which is being is one.—But as every pair of contraries\n    20\n         m-ivaHn 6               ky one and the same science, and in each pair one term is the\n         Question hn fk °l er (lh°ugh one might regarding some contraries raise the\n         e.g. uniust anHheytCan bf Privatively related, viz. those which have an intermediate,\n         the whole formula buinf ^               °ne mUSl maintain that lhe Privation is not of\n    25   some permanent disnn<v *S fCtreme form’ e-8-if a maa is just who is by virtue of\n         whole formula denied Vh\" °°ec^ent 10 the laws, the unjust man need not have the\n                                      lm’ kut will be in some respect deficient in obedience to\n\nBOOK XI                                       1677",
