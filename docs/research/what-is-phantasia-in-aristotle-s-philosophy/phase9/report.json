          "text": "5 • Contemporaneously with these philosophers and before them, the Pytha­\ngoreans, as they are called, devoted themselves to mathematics; they were the first\nto advance this study, and having been brought up in it they thought its                 25\nprinciples were the principles of all things. Since of these principles numbers are by\nnature the first, and in numbers they seemed to see many resemblances to the things\nthat exist and come into being—more than in fire and earth and water (such and\nsuch a modification of numbers being justice, another being soul and reason,\nanother being opportunity—and similarly almost all other things being numerically        30\nexpressible); since, again, they saw that the attributes and the ratios of the musical\nscales were expressible in numbers; since, then, all other things seemed in their\nwhole nature to be modelled after numbers, and numbers seemed to be the first\nthings in the whole of nature, they supposed the elements of numbers to be the           986'i\nelements of all things, and the whole heaven to be a musical scale and a number.\nAnd all the properties of numbers and scales which they could show to agree with\nthe attributes and parts and the whole arrangement of the heavens, they collected        5\nand fitted into their scheme; and if there was a gap anywhere, they readily made\nadditions so as to make their whole theory coherent. E.g. as the number 10 is\nthought to be perfect and to comprise the whole nature of numbers, they say that\nthe bodies which move through the heavens are ten, but as the visible bodies are only    io\nnine, to meet this they invent a tenth—the ‘counter-earth’. We have discussed these\nmatters more exactly elsewhere.\n      But the object of our discussion is that we may learn from these philosophers\nalso what they suppose to be the principles and how these fall under the causes we       15\nhave named. Evidently, then, these thinkers also consider that number is the\nprinciple both as matter for things and as forming their modifications and states,\nand hold that the elements of number are the even and the odd, and of these the\nformer is unlimited, and the latter limited; and the 1 proceeds from both of these\n(for it is both even and odd), and number from the 1; and the whole heaven, as has       20\nbeen said, is numbers.\n      Other members of this same school say there are ten principles, which they\narrange in two columns of cognates—limit and unlimited, odd and even, one and\nplurality, right and left, male and female, resting and moving, straight and curved,     25\nlight and darkness, good and bad, square and oblong. In this way Alcmaeon of\nCroton seems also to have conceived the matter,2 and either he got this view from\nthem or they got it from him; for he expressed himself similarly to them. For he says    30\nmost human affairs go in pairs, meaning not definite contrarieties such as the\nPythagoreans speak of, but any chance contrarieties, e.g. white and black, sweet\nand bitter, good and bad, great and small. He threw out indefinite suggestions about\n\nISomc aulhorities read; ‘For Alcmaeon lived during the old age\n                         of Pythagoras, and he expressed himself...’.\n\n1560                          metaphysics",

If, then, there is something in what the\npoets say, and jealousy is natural to the divine power, it would probably occur in this                     983*1\ncase above all, and all who excelled in this knowledge would be unfortunate. But the\ndivine power cannot be jealous (indeed, according to the proverb, ‘bards tell many a\nlie’), nor should any science be thought more honourable than one of this sort. For\nthe most divine science is also most honourable; and this science alone is, in two                          5\nways, most divine. For the science which it would be most meet for God to have is a\ndivine science, and so is any science that deals with divine objects; and this science\nalone has both these qualities; for God is thought to be among the causes of all\nthings and to be a first principle, and such a science either God alone can have, or\nGod above all others. All the sciences, indeed, are more necessary than this, but                           10\nnone is better.\n       Yet the acquisition of it must in a sense end in something which is the opposite\nof our original inquiries. For all men begin, as we said, by wondering that the matter\nis so (as in the case of automatic marionettes or the solstices or the incommensura­                        15\nbility of the diagonal of a square with the side; for it seems wonderful to all men who\nhave not yet perceived the explanation that there is a thing which cannot be\nmeasured even by the smallest unit). But we must end in the contrary and,\naccording to the proverb, the better state, as is the case in these instances when men\nlearn the cause; for there is nothing which would surprise a geometer so much as if                         20\nthe diagonal turned out to be commensurable.\n      We have stated, then, what is the nature of the science we are searching for,\nand what is the mark which our search and our whole investigation must reach.\n\n3 • Evidently we have to acquire knowledge of the original causes (for we say\nwe know each thing only when we think we recognize its first cause), and causes are                         25\nspoken of in four senses. In one of these we mean the substance, i.e. the essence (for\nthe ‘why’ is referred finally to the formula,1 and the ultimate ‘why’ is a cause and\nprinciple); in another the matter or substratum, in a third the source of the change,                       30\nand in a fourth the cause opposed to this, that for the sake of which and the good\n(for this is the end of all generation and change). We have studied these causes\nsufficiently in our work on nature, but yet let us call to our aid those who have                           983bl\nattacked the investigation of being and philosophized about reality before us. For\nobviously they too speak of certain principles and causes; to go over their views,\nthen, will be of profit to the present inquiry, for we shall either find another kind of\ncause, or be more convinced of the correctness of those which we now maintain.                              5\n      Of the first philosophers, most thought the principles which were of the nature\n\n‘In the translation of the Metaphysics ‘formula* (or ‘definitory formula*) renders ‘\\oyos’.\n\n1556                          metaphysics",

If, then, a man has theory without experience, and knows the universal but\ndoes not know the individual included in this, he will often fail to cure; for it is the\nindividual that is to be cured. But yet we think that knowledge and understanding                  i\nbelong to art rather than to experience, and we suppose artists to be wiser than men       25      :\nof experience (which implies that wisdom depends in all cases rather on knowl­\nedge); and this because the former know the cause, but the latter do not. For men of\nexperience know that the thing is so, but do not know why, while the others know the\n‘why’ and the cause. Hence we think that the master-workers in each craft are more         30\nhonourable and know in a truer sense and are wiser than the manual workers,\nbecause they know the causes of the things that are done (we think the manual              981*1\nworkers are like certain lifeless things which act indeed, but act without knowing\nwhat they do, as fire burns,—but while the lifeless things perform each of their\nfunctions by a natural tendency, the labourers perform them through habit); thus\nwe view them as being wiser not in virtue of being able to act, but of having the          5\ntheory for themselves and knowing the causes. And in general it is a sign of the man\nwho knows, that he can teach, and therefore we think art more truly knowledge than\nexperience is; for artists can teach, and men of mere experience cannot.                               ;\n      Again, we do not regard any of the senses as wisdom; yet surely these give the       10\nmost authoritative knowledge of particulars. But they do not tell us the ‘why’ of\nanything—e.g. why fire is hot; they only say that it is hot.\n                                                                                                       !\n      At first he who invented any art that went beyond the common perceptions of\nman was naturally admired by men, not only because there was something useful in           15\nthe inventions, but because he was thought wise and superior to the rest. But as\nmore arts were invented, and some were directed to the necessities of life, others to                  •:\nits recreation, the inventors of the latter were always regarded as wiser than the\ninventors of the former, because their branches of knowledge did not aim at utility.       20\nHence when all such inventions were already established, the sciences which do not\naim at giving pleasure or at the necessities of life were discovered, and first in the\nplaces where men first began to have leisure. This is why the mathematical arts\nwere founded in Egypt; for there the priestly caste was allowed to be at leisure.\n      We have said in the Ethics what the difference is between art and science and        25\nthe other kindred faculties; but the point of our present discussion is this, that all\nmen suppose what is called wisdom to deal with the first causes and the principles of\nthings. This is why, as has been said before, the man of experience is thought to be       30\nwiser than the possessors of any perception whatever, the artist wiser than the men\nof experience, the master-worker than the mechanic, and the theoretical kinds of\nknowledge to be more of the nature of wisdom than the productive. Clearly then             982*1\nwisdom is knowledge about certain causes and principles.\n\n2 • Since we are seeking this knowledge, we must inquire of what kind are\nthe causes and the principles, the knowledge of which is wisdom. If we were to take        5\nthe notions we have about the wise man, this might perhaps make the answer more\n\n1554                           metaphysics",

For on the one hand, if all opinions\nand appearances are true, all statements must be at the same time true and false.\nFor many men hold beliefs in which they conflict with one another, and all think             10\nthose mistaken who have not the same opinions as themselves; so that the same\nthing must be and not be. And on the other hand, if this is so, all opinions must be\ntrue; for those who are mistaken and those who are right are opposed to one another\nin their opinions; if, then, reality is such as the view in question supposes, all will be\nright in their beliefs. Evidently, then, both doctrines proceed from the same way of         15\nthinking.\n      But the same method of discussion must not be used with all opponents; for\nsome need persuasion, and others compulsion. Those who have been driven to this\nposition by difficulties in their thinking can easily be cured of their ignorance; for it\nis not their expressed argument but their thought that one has to meet. But those            20\nwho argue for the sake of argument can be convinced only by emending the\nargument as expressed in words.\n     Those who really feel the difficulties have been led to this opinion by\nobservation of the sensible world. They think that contradictions or contraries are\ntrue at the same time, because they see contraries coming into existence out of the\nsame thing. If, then, that which is not cannot come to be, the thing must have               25\nexisted before as both contraries alike, as Anaxagoras says all is mixed in all, and\nDemocritus too; for he says the void and the full exist alike in every part, and yet one\nof these is being, and the other non-being. To those, then, whose belief rests on these      30\ngrounds, we shall say that in a sense they speak rightly and in a sense they err. For\n‘that which is’ has two meanings, so that in some sense a thing can come to be out of\nthat which is not, while in some sense it cannot, and the same thing can at the same\ntime be and not be—but not in the same respect. For the same thing can be\npotentially at the same time two contraries, but it cannot actually. And again we            35\nshall ask them to believe that among existing things there is another kind of\nsubstance to which neither movement nor destruction nor generation at all\nbelongs.\n      And similarly some have inferred from the sensible world the truth of                  I009b!\nappearances. For they think that the truth should not be determined by the large or\nsmall number of those who hold a belief, and that the same thing is thought sweet by\nsome who taste it, and bitter by others, so that if all were ill or all were mad, and\nonly two or three were well or sane, these would be thought ill and mad, and not the         5\nothers. And again, many of the other animals receive impressions contrary to ours;\nand even to the senses of each individual, things do not always seem the same.\nWhich, then, of these impressions are true and which are false is not obvious; for the\none set is no more true than the other, but both are alike. And this is why                  10\n\n1594                          metaphysics",

Again, the Forms are patterns not only\nof sensible things, but of themselves too, e.g. the Form of genus will be a genus of       30\n Forms; therefore the same thing will be pattern and copy.\n       Again it must be held to be impossible that the substance and that of which it is   99i*i\nthe substance should exist apart; how, therefore, can the Ideas, being the substances\nof things, exist apart?\n       In the Phaedo the case is stated in this way—that the Forms are causes both of\n being and of becoming; yet when the Forms exist, still the things that share in them\ndo not come into being, unless there is some efficient cause; and many other things        5\ncome into being (e.g. a house or a ring), of which we say there are no Forms.\nClearly, therefore, even the other things can both be and come into being owing to\nsuch causes as produce the things just mentioned.\n       Again, if the forms are numbers, how can they be causes? Is it because existing\nthings are other numbers, e.g. one number is man, another is Socrates, another             io\nCallias? Why then are the one set of numbers causes of the other set? It will not\nmake any difference even if the former are eternal and the latter are not. But if it is\nbecause things in this sensible world (e.g. harmony) are ratios of numbers, evidently\nthere is some one class of things of which they are ratios. If, then, this—the\nmatter—is some definite thing, evidently the numbers themselves too will be ratios         15\nof something to something else. E.g. if Callias is a numerical ratio between fire and\nearth and water and air, his Idea also will be a number of certain other underlying\nthings; and the Idea of man, whether it is a number in a sense or not, will still be a\nnumerical ratio of certain things and not a number proper, nor will it be a number\nmerely because it is a numerical ratio.                                                    20\n       Again, from many numbers one number is produced, but how can one Form\ncome from many Forms? And if the number comes not from the many numbers\nthemselves but from the units in them, e.g. in 10,000, how is it with the units? If\nthey are specifically alike, numerous absurdities will follow, and also if they are not\nalike (neither the units in the same number being like one another nor those in            25\ndifferent numbers being all like to all); for in what will they differ, as they are\nwithout quality? This is not a plausible view, nor can it be consistently thought out.\nFurther, they must set up a second kind of number (with which arithmetic deals),\nand all the objects which are called intermediate by some thinkers; and how do\nthese exist or from what principles do they proceed? Or why must they be\nintermediate between the things in this sensible world and the things-in-                  30\nthemselves? Further, the units in 2 must each come from a prior 2; but this is\nimpossible. Further, why is a number, when taken all together, one? Again, besides         992M\nwhat has been said, if the units are diverse they should have spoken like those who\nsay there are four, or two, elements; for each of these thinkers gives the name of\nelement not to that which is common, e.g. to body, but to fire and earth, whether          5\nthere is something common to them, viz. body, or not. But in fact they speak as if the\nOne were homogeneous like fire or water; and if this is so, the numbers will not be\n\n1568                           metaphysics",

For those who speak of reason or friendship class these\ncauses as goods; they do not speak, however, as if anything that exists either existed\nor came into being for the sake of these, but as if movements started from these. In       10\nthe same way those who say the One or the existent is the good, say that it is the\ncause of substance, but not that substance either is or comes to be for the sake of\nthis. Therefore it turns out that in a sense they both say and do not say the good is a\ncause; for they do not call it a cause qua good but only incidentally.                     15\n       All these thinkers, then, as they cannot pitch on another cause, seem to testify\nthat we have determined rightly both how many and of what sort the causes are.\nBesides this it is plain that when the causes are being looked for, either all four must\nbe sought thus or they must be sought in one of these four ways. Let us next discuss\nthe possible difficulties with regard to the way in which each of these thinkers has\nspoken, and with regard to his views about the first principles.                           20\n\n8 • Those, then, who say the universe is one and posit one kind of thing as\nmatter, and as corporeal matter which has spatial magnitude, evidently go astray in\nmany ways. For they posit the elements of bodies only, not of incorporeal things, 25\nthough there are incorporeal things. And in trying to state the causes of generation\nand destruction, and in giving an account of the nature of all things, they do away\nwith the cause of movement. Further, they err in not positing the substance, i.e. the\nessence, as the cause of anything, and besides this in lightly calling any of the simple\nbodies except earth the first principle, without inquiring how they are produced out 30\nof one another,—I mean fire, water, earth, and air. For some things are produced\nout of others by combination, others by separation, and this makes the greatest\ndifference to their priority and posteriority. For in a way the property of being most\nelementary of all would seem to belong to the first thing from which they are\nproduced by combination, and this property would belong to the most fine-grained 989-1\nand subtle of bodies. Therefore those who make fire the principle would be most in\nagreement with this argument. But each of the other thinkers agrees that the\nelement of corporeal things is of this sort. At least none of the later philosophers\nwho said the world was one claimed that earth was the element, evidently because of 5\nthe coarseness of its grain. (Of the other three elements each has found some judge\non its side; for some maintain that fire, others that water, others that air is the\nelement. Yet why, after all, do they not name earth also, as most men do—for\npeople say all things are earth. And Hesiod says earth was produced first of 10\ncorporeal things; so ancient and popular has the opinion been.) According to this\nargument, then, no one would be right who either says the first principle is any of\nthe elements other than fire, or supposes it to be denser than air but rarer than\nwater. But if that which is later in generation is prior in nature, and that which is 15\nconcocted and compounded is later in generation, the contrary of what we have\nbeen saying must be true,—water must be prior to air, and earth to water.\n      Let this suffice, then, as our statement about those who posit one cause such as\nwe mentioned; but the same is true if we suppose more of these, as Empedocles says 20\n\n1564                          metaphysics",

Since, then, a 25\nthing can become not-white, having been perfectly white and in no respect\nnot-whitc, that which becomes white must come from that which is not-white; so\nthat a thing must come to be out of that which is not (so they argue), unless the\nsame thing was at the beginning both not-white and white. But it is not hard to solve 30\nthis difficulty; for we have said in the Physics' in what sense things that come to be\ncome to be from that which is not, and in what sense from that which is.\n      But to lend oneself equally to the opinions and the fancies of disputing parties\nis foolish; for clearly one of them must be mistaken. And this is evident from what\nhappens in sensation; for the same thing never appears sweet to some and bitter to 1063M\nothers, unless in the one case the sense-organ which discriminates the aforesaid\nflavours has been perverted and injured. And if this is so the one party must be\ntaken to be the measure, and the other must not. And I say the same of good and 5\nbad, and beautiful and ugly, and all other such qualities. For to maintain the view\nwe are opposing is just like maintaining the truth of what appears to people who put\ntheir finger under their eye and make the object appear two instead of one, i.e. like\nsaying that it is two (because it appears to be of that number) and again one (for to\nthose who do not interfere with their eye the one object appears one).                  10\n      In general, it is absurd to make the fact that the things of this earth are\nobserved to change and never to remain in the same state, the basis of our\njudgements about the truth. For in pursuing the truth one must start from the\nthings that are always in the same state and suffer no change. Such are the heavenly 15\nbodies; for these do not appear to be now of one nature and again of another, but are\nmanifestly always the same and share in no change.\n      Further, if there is movement, and something moved, and everything is moved\nout of something and into something, it follows that that which is moved must first\nbe in that out of which it is to be moved, and then not be in it, and move into the 20\nother and come to be in it, and that the contradictory statements are not true at the\nsame time, as our opponents assert they are.\n      And if the things of this earth continuously flow and move in respect of\nquantity—if one were to suppose this, although it is not true—why should they not\nendure in respect of quality? For the assertion of contradictory statements about\nthe same thing seems to have arisen largely from the belief that the quantity of 25\nbodies does not endure, so that the same thing both is and is not four cubits long. But\nthe substance depends on quality, and this is of determinate nature, though quantity\nis indeterminate.\n      Further, when the doctor orders people to take some particular food, why do\nthey take it? For why is this bread rather than not bread?—so that it would make 30\nno difference whether one ate or not. But as a matter of fact they take it, assuming\n\n1 Physics I 8.\n\n1680                           metaphysics",

This—the finding of treasure—happens by accident to the man who\ndigs the hole; for neither does the one come of necessity from the other or after the\nother, nor, if a man plants, does he usually find treasure. And a musical man might\nbe white; but since this does not happen of necessity nor usually, we call it an            20\naccident. Therefore since there are attributes and they attach to a subject, and some\nof them attach in a particular place and at a particular time, whatever attaches to a\nsubject, but not because it is this subject, at this time or in this place, will be an\naccident. Therefore there is no definite cause for an accident, but a chance cause,         25\ni.e. an indefinite one. Going to Aegina was an accident, if the man went not in order\nto get there, but because he was carried out of his way by a storm or captured by\npirates. The accident has happened or exists,—not in virtue of itself, however, but of\nsomething else; for the storm was the cause of his coming to a place for which he\nwas not sailing, and this was Aegina.\n      ‘Accident’ has also another meaning, i.e. what attaches to each thing in virtue       30\nof itself but is not in its substance, as having its angles equal to two right angles\nattaches to the triangle. And accidents of this sort may be eternal, but no accident\nof the other sort is. This is explained elsewhere.\n\nBOOK VI (E)\n\n1 • We are seeking the principles and the causes of the things that are, and\nobviously of things qua being. For there is a cause of health and of good condition,\nand the objects of mathematics have principles and elements and causes, and in              5\ngeneral every science which is ratiocinative or at all involves reasoning deals with\ncauses and principles, exact or indeterminate; but all these sciences mark off some\nparticular being—some genus, and inquire into this, but not into being simply nor\nqua being, nor do they offer any discussion of the essence of the things of which they      10\ntreat; but starting from the essence—some making it plain to the senses, others\nassuming it as a hypothesis—they then demonstrate, more or less cogently, the\nessential attributes of the genus with which they deal. It is obvious, therefore, from\nsuch a review of the sciences, that there is no demonstration of substance or of the\nessence, but some other way of revealing it. And similarly the sciences omit the            15\nquestion whether the genus with which they deal exists or does not exist, because it\nbelongs to the same line of thought to show what it is and that it is.\n      And since natural science, like other sciences, confines itself to one class of\nbeings, i.e. to that sort of substance which has the principle of its movement and rest     20\npresent in itself, evidently it is neither practical nor productive. For the principle of\nproduction is in the producer—it is either reason or art or some capacity, while the\nprinciple of action is in the doer—viz. choice, for that which is done and that which\nis chosen are the same. Therefore, if all thought is either practical or productive or      25\ntheoretical, natural science must be theoretical, but it will theorize about such being\n\n1620                           metaphysics",
