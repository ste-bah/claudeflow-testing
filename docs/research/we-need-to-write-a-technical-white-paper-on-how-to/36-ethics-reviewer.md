## IRB Classification

### Recommended Level: Expedited Review

**Regulatory Basis**: 45 CFR 46.110, Category 7

**Category 7 Criteria**:
- Research on individual or group characteristics or behavior
- Research employing survey, interview, oral history, focus group, program evaluation, human factors evaluation, or quality assurance methodologies

**Rationale for Expedited (Not Exempt)**:

The research does NOT qualify for exempt status because:
1. Survey data includes professional opinions that could theoretically identify participants if linked to publicly available LinkedIn profiles
2. Organizational cost data, while anonymized, represents sensitive business information
3. Interview data includes detailed descriptions of organizational practices

The research DOES qualify for expedited review because:
1. Risk level is minimal (risks no greater than everyday professional activities)
2. No vulnerable populations are involved
3. Research involves survey/interview methodologies with competent adult professionals
4. Data collection does not involve invasive procedures

**Alternative Considered**: Exempt Category 2(ii) - surveys where disclosure would not place subjects at risk. Rejected because organizational affiliation combined with detailed governance descriptions could theoretically enable identification.

### Documentation Required for IRB Submission

- [X] IRB application form (institution-specific)
- [X] Study protocol (detailed procedures)
- [X] Informed consent forms (S1 survey, S2 data sharing, S7 interview)
- [X] Recruitment materials (email templates, LinkedIn posts)

## Risk Assessment

### Physical Risks

**Level**: None

**Assessment**: This research involves no physical contact, biological specimens, or physical interventions. All data collection occurs remotely via online surveys and video interviews.

**Risks Identified**: None

**Mitigation Required**: None

### Psychological Risks

**Level**: Minimal

**Assessment**: Participants may experience minimal stress when reflecting on organizational security practices, particularly if they perceive their practices as inadequate. This risk is comparable to normal professional self-reflection.

**Risks Identified**:
1. Discomfort discussing organizational security gaps
2. Potential concern about job performance implications
3. Minor interview fatigue (60-minute interviews)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Emphasize no "right" answers in surveys and interviews
- Remind participants that findings are anonymized and aggregated
- Provide option to skip sensitive questions
- Offer breaks during interviews
- Include debriefing information about study purpose

**Assessment Justification**: These risks do not exceed those encountered in everyday professional activities such as performance reviews, job interviews, or professional development assessments.

### Social Risks

**Level**: Minimal

**Assessment**: Disclosure of organizational security practices could theoretically affect professional reputation if linked to specific organizations. This risk is mitigated by anonymization procedures.

**Risks Identified**:
1. Potential embarrassment if poor security practices are linked to organization
2. Theoretical impact on professional reputation if responses disclosed
3. Peer judgment if participation becomes known

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Full anonymization of all individual and organizational identifiers
- Aggregate reporting only (no individual case presentations without consent)
- Secure data storage with access controls
- Clear confidentiality commitments in consent forms
- No reporting of individual organization names or identifying characteristics

### Economic Risks

**Level**: Minimal

**Assessment**: Economic risks are minimal. Organizational cost data could theoretically be competitively sensitive, but anonymization prevents identification.

**Risks Identified**:
1. Competitive sensitivity of organizational cost data
2. Potential employer concern about participation (time investment)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Cost data anonymized (ORG_001, ORG_002, etc.)
- Only aggregate statistics reported (ranges, means, not individual values)
- Survey completion time (15-20 min) comparable to routine professional activities
- Participation is voluntary and not reported to employers
- Compensation ($100) disclosed to prevent coercion perception

### Legal Risks

**Level**: None to Minimal

**Assessment**: No illegal behavior is solicited or likely to be disclosed. Security practices discussed are lawful professional activities.

**Risks Identified**:
1. Theoretical disclosure of security vulnerabilities (unlikely given survey design)
2. Potential regulatory implications if compliance gaps disclosed

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Survey items focus on practices and capabilities, not specific vulnerabilities
- No questions ask about security incidents or breaches
- Interview guide focuses on governance structures, not security failures
- Certificate of Confidentiality NOT required (no federally funded research involving sensitive topics)

**Limits of Confidentiality**: Standard research confidentiality applies. Researchers are not legally mandated reporters. However, consent forms clearly state that confidentiality is not absolute and may be breached if legally compelled (e.g., court order).

### Risk-Benefit Analysis

**Benefits**:

To Participants:
- $100 Amazon gift card compensation (S1)
- $500 administrative compensation + benchmarking report (S2)
- $150 compensation (S7 interviews)
- Access to research findings
- Professional development through reflection on practices

To Society:
- Improved understanding of AWS multi-account security governance
- Evidence-based recommendations for security practitioners
- Validated cost models for budget planning
- Public knowledge contribution via white paper

**Risks** (Summarized):
- Minimal psychological discomfort
- Minimal social/reputational risk (mitigated by anonymization)
- Minimal economic risk (mitigated by anonymization)
- No physical or significant legal risks

**Conclusion**: Risks are minimized through comprehensive anonymization, voluntary participation, and informed consent. Risks are reasonable relative to anticipated benefits. The anticipated benefits to participants (compensation, professional development) and society (improved security practices) outweigh the minimal risks.

## Radical Honesty Notes (INTJ + Type 8)

### What This Ethics Review Provides

1. **Complete IRB-ready documentation**: All required elements for expedited review submission
2. **Regulatory compliance assessment**: GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, FERPA evaluated
3. **Risk-benefit analysis**: Transparent assessment with honest risk acknowledgment
4. **Operational procedures**: Consent mechanisms, data security, breach response

### Limitations Acknowledged

1. **IRB requirements vary**: Specific forms and procedures depend on institutional IRB
2. **Regulatory applicability uncertain**: GDPR/CCPA applicability depends on actual participant locations
3. **Funding source unknown**: Conflict assessment incomplete without funding disclosure
4. **Protocol number placeholder**: Actual number assigned by IRB upon approval

### Honest Assessment of Risk Level

This research involves **genuinely minimal risk**:
- No physical interventions
- Professional surveys/interviews on work practices
- Comprehensive anonymization
- No vulnerable populations
- Standard professional activities as comparison

However, I will not downplay theoretical risks:
- Organizational practices could theoretically enable identification
- Cost data is business-sensitive even if anonymized
- Interview depth creates identification risk that requires careful de-identification

### Critical Requirements Before Data Collection

**No data collection without IRB approval** - this is non-negotiable regardless of project timeline pressures.

The Security Hub 2025 migration deadline (January 31, 2026) creates urgency, but ethics compliance cannot be compromised. If IRB approval takes longer than expected, the timeline must adjust, not the ethics procedures.

### What This Review Cannot Guarantee

1. IRB approval (institutional review may raise additional concerns)
2. Complete regulatory compliance (laws change; consult legal counsel)
3. Zero risk (minimal risk is not zero risk)
4. Participant understanding (consent forms do not ensure comprehension)
