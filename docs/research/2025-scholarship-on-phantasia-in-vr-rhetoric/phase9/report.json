          "text": "3. The Definition of Phantasia\nAlthough the introductory section of De anima, III, 3 points forward to\nthe theme of nous, Aristotle’s analysis of phantasia itself depends\nheavily on his preceding account of aisthesis. In searching for a defini¬\ntion of phantasia, we must see how the inner appearances have their\nroots in the act of sensation.\n   Among the many and complex ways in which things can “appear” to\nman, the most fundamental and paradigmatic seems to be the striking\nand continuous presentation of things to his senses. The close resem¬\nblance between sensation and the inner appearances is dramatically\nevident in the phantasia of dreaming, in which the dreamer takes him¬\nself to be actually seeing and hearing things beyond himself. It is thus not\nsurprising that Aristotle defines phantasia a number of times, in very\ndifferent contexts, as a function of aisthesis.48 On the other hand, in his\n46 III, 3, 427b17-24.\n47 427b27-29.\n48 De anima. III, 3, 429al-2; De insomniis, 1, 459al7-18; Rhetoric, I, 11, 1370a27. It is\n   customary to compare the Rhetoric's definition of phantasia as a “certain weak\n   sensation” (aisthesis tis asthenes) with Hobbes’ remark in Leviathan, ch. 2, that\n   “imagination is therefore nothing but decaying sense”.\n\nPhantasia 495\n\ndiscussion of the law of non-contradiction, he pointedly remarks that\nphantasia is not the same thing as aisthesis.4^\n  The identification of phantasia and aisthesis is associated by Plato\nand Aristotle with the name of Protagoras, which they take to be\nemblematic of an elaborate doctrine of the instability of the world and of\nthe subjective and material character of knowledge. Both present the\nProtagorean theme of the truth of the phainomena from a hostile point of\nview, answering it, on the one hand, with a doctrine of an immobile and\nimmaterial being, and, on the other hand, with a firm distinction between\nsensation and knowledge.50 Thus set against the background of the\nopposition between ousia and genesis, the theme of phantasia as a\ndistinct activity of the soul arises, as in the De anima, the De memoria,\nand the De insomniis ,51 in the gap opened up by the separation between\nsensing and thinking. Phantasia seems to resemble each of these in\ncertain ways, which may explain the Protagorean confusion between\nthem, while it also serves as the link between them in the Aristotelian\nexplanation of knowledge.\n   Aristotle opens the thematic discussion of phantasia with five indica¬\ntions which distinguish it from sensation. Among these, the decisive\npoint seems to be that an “appearing” (phainetai) may occur when the\nsense-powers are inoperative, as in dreams or when one’s eyes are\nclosed, so that phantasia cannot be the same thing as sensation.52 On the\nother hand, he observes as a matter of fact that phantasia seems not to\noccur without sensation, since both take place in the same subjects and\nare directed to the same objects.53 It is in establishing the precise relation\nbetween these two activities that Aristotle arrives at his definition of\nphantasia.\n   Sensation, according to Aristotle, is the distinctive power of animals,\none which may be generally described as a passive “being moved”\n(kineisthai) or “altered” (alloiousthai) or “acted upon” (paschein).\nMore specifically, it is a process of actualization (energein) in which the\npassive sense-power is impinged upon by its object, somewhat in the\nway that fuel is kindled by fire; in an interpretation of the saying that\n“like is known by like”, Aristotle explains this actualization as an\nassimilation {homoiotai} in which the sense-power begins as unlike its\nobject, and is transformed into a likeness of it. Finally, sensation in¬\nvolves the reception of sensible forms without their matter, just as wax\n49 Metaphysics , IV, 5, 1010b3.\n50 The Platonic response to Protagoras is found in Socrates’ uncovering of the presuppo¬\n   sitions and consequences of Theaetetus’ definition of episteme as aisthesis (Theae-\n   tetus, 151d3-186el2); phantasia is identified with aisthesis near the beginning of the\n   argument (152c1). Aristotle alludes to this discussion while opposing to the Protagorean\n   view of the phainomena the famous “law of non-contradiction” (Metaphysics, IV, 5,\n   1010bl2).\n51 III, 3, 427al7-bl4; 1, 449b9-30; 1, 458bl-22.\n52 428a5-16.\n53 428bll-13.\n\n496   Dialogue",

          "text": "Phantasia        485\n\napparently the first writer both to have used it regularly and to have\ndiscussed its meaning at length. It is, however, formed from older and\nless technical words which offer some suggestive indications of its\noriginal significance. Although Aristotle’s derivation of it from phaos\n(“light”)6 may not be strictly correct, both words seem ultimately to\ncome from the verb phad, which means “to give light, shine, beam,\nespecially of the heavenly bodies” .7 From this latter word were derived\nthe two verbs phaind (“to show”), with its frequent middle form phai-\nnomai (“to appear”), and phantazo (“to make visible, appear, show\noneself”), and thence the verbal nouns phantasia and phantasma .6\nBoth Plato and Aristotle closely associate phantasia with phainomai in\ncontexts which suggest that phantasia designates the result of the action\nof appearing, and might, like phainomenon, be translated simply as\n“appearance”.9 In terms of its genealogy, then, phantasia would seem\nto indicate the effect of a prominent or merely noticeable self¬\npresentation of something to eyesight, though it quickly seems to have\nacquired the wide meaning of “a presentation to consciousness,\nwhether immediate or in memory, whether true or illusory”.10 Thus,\nwhile derived from a term pointing to the spectacle of the heavenly\nbodies, phantasia itself names the manifestation of anything before\nman, perhaps especially a display in the sensible, and above all, in the\nvisible world, but also including any presentation in dreams, memories,\nfancies, and delusions. Taken together, the array of all such appearances\nforms the scene of the pre-philosophic dimension of human experience\nwhich precedes and conditions man’s subsequent questions about the\ntruth of things.11\n    260e4, 263 d6 , 264a6. On the po ssib ility that the term may have been used by some of the\n    pre-Socratics, see the first chapter of Murray Wright Bundy, The Theory of Imagina¬\n    tion in Classical and Medieval Thought (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1927).\n 6 De anima, III, 3, 429a3-4.\n 7 Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon (Oxford: Clarendon\n    Press, 1968), “ phad\" .\n 8 Ibid., ad loc.\n 9 See, forinstance, Theaetetus , 152cl , and Metaphysics, IV, 5, 1010b1-4.

For the origins of the discus¬\n    sion in Leibniz’ description of bodies as phaenomena realia and in Kant’s radical\n     modem revision of the meaning of the phenomena , see the article on\" Erscheinung” in\n    Historisches Wdrleibtich der Philosophic (Basel and Stuttgart: Schwabe, 1972).

It might be observed that while the history of Greek philosophy\n    proceeds from the Protagorean doctrine of the truth of the phainomena to the crucial\n     Platonic distinction between the phainomena and the onta (Republic, X, 596e4), the\n\n486 Dialogue",

          "text": "10       4 • Turning now to the part of the soul with which the soul knows and\n       (whether this is separable from the others in definition only, or spatially as well) we\n       have to inquire what differentiates this part, and how thinking can take place.\n            If thinking is like perceiving, it must be either a process in which the soul is\n      acted upon by what is capable of being thought, or a process different from but\n   15 analogous to that. The thinking part of the soul must therefore be, while impassible,\n      capable of receiving the form of an object; that is, must be potentially identical in\n      character with its object without being the object. Thought must be related to what\n      is thinkable, as sense is to what is sensible.\n            Therefore, since everything is a possible object of thought, mind in order, as\n       Anaxagoras says, to dominate, that is, to know, must be pure from all admixture;\n   20 for the co-presence of what is alien to its nature is a hindrance and a block: it follows\n       that it can have no nature of its own, other than that of having a certain capacity.\n      Thus that in the soul which is called thought (by thought I mean that whereby the\n      soul thinks and judges) is, before it thinks, not actually any real thing. For this\n   25 reason it cannot reasonably be regarded as blended with the body: if so, it would\n      acquire some quality, e.g, warmth or cold, or even have an organ like the sensitive\n      faculty: as it is, it has none. It was a good idea to call the soul ‘the place of forms’,\n      though this description holds only of the thinking soul, and even this is the forms\n      only potentially, not actually.\n            Observation of the sense-organs and their employment reveals a distinction\n   30 between the impassibility of the sensitive faculty and that of the faculty of thought.\n      After strong stimulation of a sense we are less able to exercise it than before, as e.g.\n429bi in the case of a loud sound we cannot hear easily immediately after, or in the case of\n      a bright colour or a powerful odour we cannot see or smell, but in the case of thought\n      thinking about an object that is highly thinkable renders it more and not less able\n      afterwards to think of objects that are less thinkable: the reason is that while the\n    5 faculty of sensation is dependent upon the body, thought is separable from it.\n            When thought has become each thing in the way in which a man who actually\n\n*\n\nBOOK III                                        683                    '\n                                                                                                            ; i.\n\nknows is said to do so (this happens when he is now able to exercise the power on his                  .\nown initiative), its condition is still one of potentiality, but in a different sense from                  :\n the potentiality which preceded the acquisition of knowledge by learning or\ndiscovery; and thought is then able to think of itself.33                                                   !\n      Since we can distinguish between a magnitude and what it is to be a                    10\nmagnitude, and between water and what it is to be water, and so in many other cases\n (though not in all; for in certain cases the thing and its form are identical), flesh and\nwhat it is to be flesh are discriminated either by different faculties, or by the same\nfaculty in two different states; for flesh necessarily involves matter and is like what\nis snub-nosed, a this in a this. Now it is by means of the sensitive faculty that we\ndiscriminate the hot and the cold, i.e. the factors which combined in a certain ratio        15\nconstitute flesh: the essential character of flesh is apprehended by something\ndifferent either wholly separate from the sensitive faculty or related to it as a bent\nline to the same line when it has been straightened out.\n      Again in the case of abstract objects what is straight is analogous to what is\nsnub-nosed; for it necessarily implies a continuum: its constitutive essence is\ndifferent, if we may distinguish between straightness and what is straight: let us\ntake it to be two-ness. It must be apprehended, therefore, by a different power or by        20\nthe same power in a different state. To sum up, in so far as the realities it knows are\ncapable of being separated from their matter, so it is also with the powers of\nthought.\n   The problem might be suggested: if thinking is a passive affection, then if thought\nis simple and impassible and has nothing in common with anything else, as\nAnaxagoras says, how can it come to think at all? For interaction between two\nfactors is held to require a precedent community of nature between the factors.              25\nAgain it might be asked, is thought a possible object of thought to itself? For if\nthought is thinkable per se and what is thinkable is in kind one and the same, then\neither thought will belong to everything, or it will contain some element common to\nit with all other realities which makes them all thinkable.\n      Have not we already disposed of the difficulty about interaction involving a           30                 :=\ncommon element, when we said that thought is in a sense potentially whatever is\nthinkable, though actually it is nothing until it has thought? What it thinks must\nbe34 in it just as characters may be said to be on a writing-table on which as yet           430M\nnothing actually stands written: this is exactly what happens with thought.\n      Thought is itself thinkable in exactly the same way as its objects are. For in the\ncase of objects which involve no matter, what thinks and what is thought are                        L\nidentical; for speculative knowledge and its object are identical. (Why thought is           5\nnot always thinking we must consider later.) In the case of those which contain\nmatter each of the objects of thought is only potentially present. It follows that\nwhile they will not have thought in them (for thought is a potentiality of them only\nin so far as they are capable of being disengaged from matter) thought may yet be\nthinkable.\n                                    \"Retaining 6i abrov.\n                                      \"Retaining",

          "text": "The English word “appearance” connotes an interesting polarity,\nsince an appearance is always both of something and for someone, and\nitself seems to be engendered in a unique coming-together of something\nand someone: an appearance of one thing is not like that of another,\nwhile, on the other hand, the appearance of something to one person\nmay differ from its appearance to another.12 This duality parallels a\nsimilar polarity in the word phantasia which is reflected in two basic\nuses which Aristotle makes of the word, uses described by Bonitz as\nspeciem rei obiectae ... sive veram sive fallacem and as earn actionem\nqua rerum imagines animo informamus and by J. Freudenthal as\nAussehen or Erscheinung and as Vorstellung or Einbildung14 respec¬\ntively. While this sharp distinction of meaning may conceal an important\nambiguity of the word, it seems clear that Aristotle uses the term both in\nan “objective” sense, to describe the species or “look” of something,\nand in a “subjective’’ sense, to describe the action of the soul in grasping\nsuch a “look”.15 The first sense occurs mostly in his physical writings,\n usually as naming the “look” of one of the heavenly bodies or of a\ncolour; the second usage is found in the psychological treatises, and\n describes a certain action by which the soul presents something to itself.\nSince our interest is in the human activity of phantasia , we shall all but\n exclusively be concerned with the “psychological” or “subjective”\n meaning of the word. This concern leads us to consider the special\n nature of certain kinds of “appearances” or “presentations”, namely,\n those Aristotle calls phantasmata .\n   Setting aside the transferred {kata metaphoran) meanings of the\n      —\n word perhaps referring to the “objective” sense just mentioned16\n   history of German philosophy seems to reverse this progression, beginning with Kant’s\n                                                                                           —\n   distinction between the phenomena and the noumena, and ending with phenomen¬\n   ology’s exclusive attention to the appearances. This latter development also coincides\n   with the growth of “historicism”, a modern version of the Protagorean doctrine that\n   “man is the measure of all things”.\n12 The continual engendering of unique and unrepeatable appearances by the ever-\n   renewed union of sense and sensible things is a central point in the discussion of the first\n   definition of knowledge in Plato’s Theaetetus (151d3-186e12). The fascination to which\n   this perpetual novelty gives rise is, of course, an important Platonic theme.\n13 H. Bonitz, Index Aristotelians (2nd ed.; Graz: Akademische Druck—U. Verlagsan-\n   stalt, 1955), \"phantasia” .\n14 J. Freudenthal, Ueberden Begriff des Wortes PHANTASIA bei Aristoteles (Gottingen:\n                            —\n   Druck der Universitats Buchdruckerei von E. A. Huth, 1863), 15-16.\n15 It should be mentioned that “look” is the English word chosen by Jacob Klein to\n   translate Plato’s terms eidos and idea ; see Plato’s Trilogy (Chicago, IL: University of\n   Chicago Press, 1977), 3. The visual terminology of species, Erscheinung and “look”,\n   reflects the root meaning of phantasia , but is somewhat misleading, since Aristotle will\n   relate the action of phantasia to sensation in general. The double sense of phantasia is\n   paralleled in the related term doxa , which, in the writings of Plato, also shows both an\n   “objective” and a “subjective” meaning.

          "text": "It is difficult to know what to make of the remark that sensation and\nphantasia are the same but different in einai.63 If the suggestion is that\nthe two are different activities of the same subject, both having the same\norganic foundation, the “secondary movement” of phantasia requires\nfurther physiological explanation.64 From the point of view of the De\nanima, however, the account of phantasia now seems to be complete.\nIts qualified identity with sensation explains why it is not a separate\npower and does not determine a distinct kind of soul. As the inevitable\n60 459a28-b23.\n61 De insomniis, 3, 460b28-461a8.\n62 1, 459al5-22.\n63 For discussion of this formulation, see Nussbaum, Aristotle’s De motu animalium,\n   234-236.\n64 Aristotle’s account of the physiology of phantasia in terms of reflected sensations\n   which are borne inward toward a central organ, and sometimes distorted or obscured,\n   by the currents of the blood (461a8-462a8) may be scientifically naive, but is meta¬\n   phorically precise, since the paradigmatic instance of a phantasma seems to be the\n   visible, inevitably altered reflection of the outer appearances in the fluctuating element\n   of water (cf. Republic, VI, 510al). See De prophetia in somno, 2, 464b9: the inner\n   appearances (phantasmata) are much like the “images” (eiddla) found in water.\n\n498 Dialogue\n\nafter-effect of sensation, phantasia is a dimension of the life of all animal\nsouls.65\n   Apart from the concept of kinesis, there is one other feature from\nAristotle’s account of sensation which is carried over into his discussion\nof phantasia, namely, the remark that sensation involves the reception\nof form without matter. It is because this is so, he suggests, that sensa¬\ntions and phantasiai remain in the sense organs even when the sensible\nobjects have gone.66 This lingering, resonating, echoing presence of\nsensible forms freed from their original matter appears to be the essence\nof phantasia for Aristotle. The movement in the sense-power caused by\nthe sensible object itself sets up a second movement which continues\nafter the sensation has ceased and the object has gone. The animal soul,\ntherefore, is not merely one which is in touch with its environment\nthrough the cognition of sensation, but one which carries the reverberat¬\ning effects of its past encounters with sensible objects; it is not only a\nreceiver, but also a preserver and a storehouse, of the sensible forms of\nthings.67\n\n4. Phantasia and Nous\nIt remains to show how Aristotle’s discussion of phantasia subserves\nthe analysis of noein which it introduces. What is the role of the persist¬\ning inner appearances in the activity of thinking?\n   Taking up the delicate task of explaining the origin of thinking (noein)\nin De anima, III, 4, Aristotle once again, as he had at the beginning of\nchapter three, initiates the discussion with a comparison between think¬\ning and sensation. However, having been freed of the danger of confus¬\ning thinking with sensing, or with its offspring phantasia , the compari¬\nson can now proceed more instructively. Like sensation, then, thinking\nis a certain “being acted upon” (paschein) which is possible because\nthought is receptive of (dektikon) and potentially (dunamei) identical\nwith the forms (eide) of beings. In thinking, as in sensing, cognition is\nnot to be understood by means of any a priori structure other than a\nspecific emptiness, openness, and susceptibility to the forms of things.\nAs the sense-power (aisthetikon) is to its objects, the aistheta, so, by\nstrict analogy, is nous to the noeta, with the crucial difference that,\nunlike sensation, the operation of thought is free of any admixture\n(amige), whether in the power or in its object, with matter and the\n body.68\n65 Aristotle suggests a division between animals which have phantasia and those which\n   do not (De anima, II, 3, 415al0-ll; III, 3, 428al0-l 1), but finally allows that even the\n   imperfect animals possess an indeterminate phantasia (ibid., Ill, 11, 433b31-434a4).\n66 De anima, III, 2, 425b23-25.\n67 Thus Aristotle’ s phantasia resembles very much the memoria eloquently described by\n   St. Augustine ( Confessions , X, 8-26): venio in campos et lata praetoria memoriae, ubi\n   stmt thesauri inntimerabilitim imaainum de cuiusce modi rebus sensis invectarum . .\n68 429al3-18.\n\nPhantasia 499",
