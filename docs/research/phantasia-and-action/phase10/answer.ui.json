    "short_answer_md": "Aristotle's concept of phantasia is central to his explanation of action. Phantasia is the animal's awareness of an object or state of affairs, which can serve to present the object of desire initially and later specify the object as what is desired. Phantasia is vulnerable to distortion and error, but is nevertheless the basis for the full range of psychic functions, including deliberation and decision-making. The role of phantasia in practical cases is similar to its role in non-practical cases, with the difference lying solely in the role played by desire.",
