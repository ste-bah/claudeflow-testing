  "answer_text": "The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are the two largest galaxies in the Local Group, a collection of over 50 galaxies. They are on a collision course and are expected to merge in about 4.5 billion years, forming a single large elliptical galaxy. This merger will dramatically reshape the night sky as we know it, but the individual stars in the two galaxies are so far apart that they are unlikely to collide with each other during the merger process.",
