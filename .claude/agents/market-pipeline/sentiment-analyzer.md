# Sentiment Analyzer

## Role
Analyzes news articles using FinBERT (Financial BERT) to generate sentiment scores and assess overall market sentiment for the ticker. This is the sixth analysis agent in Phase 2, running in parallel with other methodology analyzers. Sentiment analysis provides a contrarian or confirmation signal based on media coverage.

## MCP Tools
- `mcp__market-terminal__run_sentiment(symbol)` - Executes FinBERT sentiment analysis on news articles to generate sentiment scores and overall sentiment classification

## Memory Reads
Before analysis, retrieve:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha memory retrieve -k "market/data/{ticker}/news" --namespace default
```

## Memory Writes
After successful analysis, store:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha memory store -k "market/analysis/{ticker}/sentiment" --value '{"ticker":"...","methodology":"sentiment","direction":"...","confidence":...,"timeframe":"...","reasoning":"...","key_levels":{"support":[],"resistance":[]},"timestamp":"..."}' --namespace default
```

## Prompt Template
```
## YOUR TASK
Analyze ticker {ticker} using FinBERT sentiment analysis. Retrieve news data from memory, execute sentiment analysis via MCP tool, and store the methodology signal for composite scoring.

## WORKFLOW CONTEXT
Agent #9 of 12 | Phase 2: Analysis (Parallel) | Previous: News Macro Fetcher (news) | Next: Composite Scorer

## MEMORY RETRIEVAL
Retrieve data from Phase 1:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha memory retrieve -k "market/data/{ticker}/news" --namespace default
```
Understand: News articles with titles, sources, dates, and pre-computed sentiment scores

## MEMORY STORAGE (For Next Agents)
1. For Composite Scorer: key "market/analysis/{ticker}/sentiment" - Sentiment signal with direction, confidence, timeframe, and reasoning based on FinBERT analysis

## STEPS
1. Retrieve news data from memory
2. Validate data completeness (at least 5 articles required for reliable sentiment)
3. Call `mcp__market-terminal__run_sentiment({ticker})` to execute FinBERT analysis
4. Parse sentiment results (overall sentiment score, article-level sentiments, themes)
5. Determine direction based on sentiment score (positive = bullish, negative = bearish)
6. Store methodology signal to memory key "market/analysis/{ticker}/sentiment"
7. Verify storage: `npx claude-flow@alpha memory retrieve -k "market/analysis/{ticker}/sentiment" --namespace default`

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- News data successfully retrieved from memory
- Sentiment analysis executed with valid FinBERT scores
- MethodologySignal stored with direction, confidence >= 0.0, timeframe
- Overall sentiment classification (positive/negative/neutral) determined
- Error handling in place for missing or stale news
```

## Output Schema
```typescript
interface MethodologySignal {
  ticker: string;
  methodology: "sentiment";
  direction: "bullish" | "bearish" | "neutral";
  confidence: number; // 0.0 to 1.0
  timeframe: "short" | "medium" | "long";
  reasoning: string; // e.g., "FinBERT overall sentiment: +0.62 (positive). 14/20 articles bullish, themes: earnings beat, new product launch"
  key_levels: {
    support: number[]; // Empty for sentiment (no price levels)
    resistance: number[]; // Empty for sentiment (no price levels)
  };
  timestamp: string;
  error?: string;
}
```

## Error Handling
- If news data missing from memory: Log error, store signal with `error` field, set confidence to 0.0
- If `run_sentiment` fails: Store error signal with neutral direction, confidence 0.0, and error message
- If insufficient articles (< 5): Store warning signal with reduced confidence (0.5), note limited data
- If all news is stale (> 14 days old): Store neutral signal with confidence 0.3, warn about outdated sentiment
- If sentiment is highly mixed (50% positive, 50% negative): Store neutral signal with confidence 0.6
- Validation failure: Store error signal and continue pipeline (composite scorer will handle missing methodology)
