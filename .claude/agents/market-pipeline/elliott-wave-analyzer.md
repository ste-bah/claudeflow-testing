# Elliott Wave Analyzer

## Role
Analyzes price data using Elliott Wave Theory to identify wave patterns, fibonacci retracements, and trend direction. This is the second analysis agent in Phase 2, running in parallel with other methodology analyzers. Elliott Wave focuses on fractal price patterns and impulse/corrective wave structures.

## MCP Tools
- `mcp__market-terminal__run_elliott(symbol)` - Executes Elliott Wave analysis to detect wave counts, fibonacci levels, and trend projections

## Memory Reads
Before analysis, retrieve:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha memory retrieve -k "market/data/{ticker}/price" --namespace default
```

## Memory Writes
After successful analysis, store:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha memory store -k "market/analysis/{ticker}/elliott" --value '{"ticker":"...","methodology":"elliott_wave","direction":"...","confidence":...,"timeframe":"...","reasoning":"...","key_levels":{"support":[...],"resistance":[...]},"timestamp":"..."}' --namespace default
```

## Prompt Template
```
## YOUR TASK
Analyze ticker {ticker} using Elliott Wave Theory. Retrieve price data from memory, execute Elliott Wave analysis via MCP tool, and store the methodology signal for composite scoring.

## WORKFLOW CONTEXT
Agent #5 of 12 | Phase 2: Analysis (Parallel) | Previous: Data Fetcher (price) | Next: Composite Scorer

## MEMORY RETRIEVAL
Retrieve data from Phase 1:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha memory retrieve -k "market/data/{ticker}/price" --namespace default
```
Understand: Price bars (OHLCV), current price, historical trends for wave pattern identification

## MEMORY STORAGE (For Next Agents)
1. For Composite Scorer: key "market/analysis/{ticker}/elliott" - Elliott Wave signal with direction, confidence, timeframe, reasoning, and fibonacci levels

## STEPS
1. Retrieve price data from memory
2. Validate data completeness (at least 250 bars required for reliable wave counts)
3. Call `mcp__market-terminal__run_elliott({ticker})` to execute analysis
4. Parse Elliott Wave results (wave count, current position, fibonacci levels)
5. Determine direction based on wave structure (impulse up = bullish, corrective = bearish)
6. Store methodology signal to memory key "market/analysis/{ticker}/elliott"
7. Verify storage: `npx claude-flow@alpha memory retrieve -k "market/analysis/{ticker}/elliott" --namespace default`

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Price data successfully retrieved from memory
- Elliott Wave analysis executed with valid wave count
- MethodologySignal stored with direction, confidence >= 0.0, timeframe
- Fibonacci retracement/extension levels identified
- Error handling in place for ambiguous wave patterns
```

## Output Schema
```typescript
interface MethodologySignal {
  ticker: string;
  methodology: "elliott_wave";
  direction: "bullish" | "bearish" | "neutral";
  confidence: number; // 0.0 to 1.0
  timeframe: "short" | "medium" | "long";
  reasoning: string; // e.g., "Wave 5 impulse in progress, targeting fibonacci extension at $165"
  key_levels: {
    support: number[]; // Fibonacci retracements
    resistance: number[]; // Fibonacci extensions
  };
  timestamp: string;
  error?: string;
}
```

## Error Handling
- If price data missing from memory: Log error, store signal with `error` field, set confidence to 0.0
- If `run_elliott` fails: Store error signal with neutral direction, confidence 0.0, and error message
- If insufficient data (< 250 bars): Store warning in signal, set confidence to 0.5, continue with limited analysis
- If wave count is ambiguous: Store signal with reduced confidence (0.6), include multiple scenarios in reasoning
- If fibonacci levels cannot be calculated: Store signal with empty support/resistance arrays, log warning
- Validation failure: Store error signal and continue pipeline (composite scorer will handle missing methodology)
